        "generated_article_body_md": "## Tesla Leadership Denial: Board Stands Firm Behind Elon Musk  \n\nTesla has strongly denied reports that its board contacted headhunters to replace CEO Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journal claimed the board sought a successor due to concerns over Musk's focus on his role in the Trump administration and Tesla's declining stock performance. However, Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm dismissed the report as \"absolutely false,\" reaffirming the board's confidence in Musk's leadership.  \n\nMusk himself criticized the WSJ, calling the article a \"breach of ethics\" and accusing the publication of ignoring Tesla's preemptive denial. The controversy comes as Tesla faces backlash from customers and investors over Musk's political affiliations and divided attention between Tesla, SpaceX, and his government advisory role.  \n\n### Unpacking the Leadership Controversy  \n\nThe Wall Street Journal's report suggested Tesla's board urged Musk to dedicate more time to the company, a claim Musk seemingly acknowledged during a recent earnings call. However, Tesla's swift denial highlights tensions between media narratives and corporate messaging. Musk's dual roles—leading Tesla while advising the Trump administration—have fueled skepticism among investors and customers alike.  \n\n#### Public and Investor Reactions  \n\nSome Tesla customers have boycotted the brand, citing Musk's political stance, while protests have occasionally turned destructive. Meanwhile, analysts argue that Musk's divided focus has contributed to Tesla's financial struggles. Despite this, Tesla's board remains publicly supportive, emphasizing Musk's role in the company's \"exciting growth plan.\"  \n\n#### Musk’s Defense and Future Commitments  \n\nMusk has pledged to reduce his government involvement, stating he will allocate \"far more time\" to Tesla. Yet, his exact timeline remains unclear. His recent quip—\"I wear a lot of hats\"—during a White House meeting underscores the balancing act he faces. With Trump expressing a desire to retain Musk, the CEO's government role may persist beyond initial expectations.  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n\n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Did Tesla really search for a new CEO?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>No. Tesla and its board have firmly denied reports of a CEO search, calling the claims \"absolutely false.\"</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Why is Elon Musk facing criticism?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Critics cite his divided focus between Tesla, SpaceX, and his advisory role in the Trump administration, along with controversial political statements.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n</div>"
