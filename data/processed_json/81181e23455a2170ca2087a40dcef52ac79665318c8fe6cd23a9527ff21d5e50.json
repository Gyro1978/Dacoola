The claims, detailed in a report published on April 24, stem from lawsuits filed by former employees Huey Hall and James Kisner, who held key financial roles at Backblaze. The lawsuits allege improper insider trading practices by the company’s founders.  \n\nAccording to Morpheus Research, the lawsuits accuse Backblaze’s leadership of executing an \"aggressive trading plan\" to sell 10,000 shares daily, beginning in April 2022 after the IPO lockup period expired. The report claims this strategy went against external financial advice, including warnings from a capital markets consultant that it might breach fiduciary duties. The allegations raise concerns about corporate governance and financial transparency at the cloud backup firm.  \n\nBackblaze has yet to provide a detailed rebuttal to the specific claims, but the company has denied any wrongdoing. The situation highlights growing scrutiny over corporate financial practices in the tech sector, particularly as cloud storage providers handle sensitive customer data."
