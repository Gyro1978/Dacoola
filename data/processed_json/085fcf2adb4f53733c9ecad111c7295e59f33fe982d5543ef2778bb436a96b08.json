Their startup funding story took a dramatic turn when they secured $2.8 million in investment, including backing from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nThis story highlights the unpredictable nature of startup success, where a single moment—like a viral tweet—can pivot a struggling business into a funded venture. It underscores the power of social media in modern entrepreneurship and serves as a reminder that persistence and timing can be just as crucial as a solid business plan. For aspiring founders, Rork’s journey offers both inspiration and a cautionary tale about the highs and lows of startup life."
