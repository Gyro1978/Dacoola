The AI chatbot will be available to children whose parents use **Family Link**, a Google service that enables families to manage and approve various Google services for their kids. This move marks a significant expansion of Gemini’s accessibility, catering to younger users under parental supervision.  \n\nThe rollout will specifically target children with parent-managed Google accounts, ensuring that guardians retain control over their child’s interactions with the AI. Family Link, which already allows parents to set digital ground rules for apps and screen time, will serve as the gateway for enabling Gemini access. Google has not yet detailed additional safeguards or content filters tailored for younger audiences.  \n\nThis development follows growing interest in AI tools for education and child-friendly digital experiences. By integrating Gemini with Family Link, Google aims to provide a supervised environment where kids can explore conversational AI while parents maintain oversight. The company has yet to confirm whether any specialized features or restrictions will accompany the under-13 rollout."
