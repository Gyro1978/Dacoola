Unlike traditional frameworks such as A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol), LOKA aims to standardize how AI agents interact by embedding identity and purpose directly into their architecture. This shift could enable more transparent and accountable AI systems, reducing ambiguity in agent behavior.  \n\nBy providing AI agents with distinct identities, LOKA ensures that each agent’s actions can be traced back to its programmed objectives, fostering trust in multi-agent environments. The protocol also defines intentions, allowing agents to communicate their goals explicitly, which could streamline collaboration and reduce conflicts in complex AI ecosystems. This development is particularly relevant as AI agents become more autonomous and integrated into critical decision-making processes.  \n\nThe implications of LOKA extend beyond technical improvements—it could redefine regulatory and ethical standards for AI. With verifiable identities, policymakers and developers may find it easier to enforce accountability and compliance in AI deployments. While still in the proposal stage, LOKA represents a significant step toward a more structured and reliable AI agent framework.  \n\nSource: [Beyond A2A and MCP: How LOKA’s Universal Agent Identity Layer changes the game](https://venturebeat.com/ai/beyond-a2a-and-mcp-how-lokas-universal-agent-identity-layer-changes-the-game/)  \n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\",\n  \"headline\": \"How LOKA’s Universal AI Agent Identity Layer Transforms AI\",\n  \"description\": \"Carnegie Mellon researchers propose LOKA, a protocol giving AI agents identities and intentions, reshaping AI interactions.\",\n  \"datePublished\": \"2025-04-28T20:35:56\",\n  \"dateModified\": \"2025-04-28T20:35:56\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"AI News Team\"\n  },\n  \"publisher\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n    \"name\": \"Dacoola\",\n    \"logo\": {\n      \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n      \"url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/A5Wdp6f.png\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"image\": {\n    \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\n    \"url\": \"https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Talker-reasoner-agent.jpg?w=1024?w=1200&strip=all\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [\"AI agent identities\"]\n}\n```",
