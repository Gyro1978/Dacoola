Journalist Brian Merchant highlighted this as evidence that the **AI job displacement** crisis is already unfolding. A former contractor revealed this isn’t a new policy, suggesting a broader trend of workforce automation in the tech sector.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis move underscores the accelerating adoption of AI in roles traditionally filled by humans, particularly in content and language services. While AI-driven efficiency benefits companies, it raises urgent questions about job security and reskilling needs. Duolingo’s shift could signal a wider industry pivot, forcing policymakers and businesses to address the socioeconomic impact of automation sooner rather than later."
