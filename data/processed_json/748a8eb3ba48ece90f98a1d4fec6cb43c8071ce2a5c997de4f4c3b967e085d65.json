Cisco’s **Foundation-sec-8B** LLM and Meta’s **AI Defenders** aim to enhance threat detection and response at scale, leveraging open-source AI cybersecurity solutions.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis collaboration signals a shift toward democratizing AI-powered security tools, making advanced threat detection more accessible to enterprises. Open-source AI models like these could lower costs and improve adaptability, allowing SOC teams to respond faster to evolving threats. By embedding these models into core workflows, Cisco and Meta are setting a precedent for scalable, AI-driven cybersecurity—a critical step as cyberattacks grow in sophistication."
