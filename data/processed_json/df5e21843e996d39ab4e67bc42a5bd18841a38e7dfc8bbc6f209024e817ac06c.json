That’s our superpower. Obviously, everything starts with great shows and movies that people love. But if you think about all of the areas where Netflix has a big advantage — our reach, our recommendations, our fandom — tech enables all those things.”\nIn the coming weeks and months, Netflix members across the world will get to experience the updated TV homepage for themselves.\nKim explained, “When we first started thinking about this project, we wanted to create an experience that was more flexible for our broad entertainment offerings, more intuitive and responsive to our members’ needs, and capable of elevating the most thrilling moments on Netflix.”\nNew features\nDiscover Your Next Great Watch More Easily: We’re putting all the information you need to make an informed choice about what to watch front and center. That way you can better focus on what makes each title relevant for you, with callouts like “Emmy Award Winner” or “No. 1 in TV Shows.”\nMore Visible Shortcuts: Until now, shortcuts to Search and My List were somewhat hidden on the left-hand side. We’re moving them to the top of the page where they’re more noticeable and easier to access.\nBetter Realtime Recommendations: We’re making the recommendations on the homepage more responsive to your moods and interests in the moment.\nElevated Design: The new homepage has a clean and modern design that better reflects the elevated experience you’ve come to expect on Netflix.\nThe mobile experience is also getting some new features:\nA New Way to Search: We’re also exploring ways to bring Generative AI to our members’ discovery experience, starting with a search feature on iOS that is a small opt-in beta. This will allow members to search for shows and movies using natural, conversational phrases like “I want something funny and upbeat.”\nA New Way to Discover: In the coming weeks, we’ll be testing a vertical feed filled with clips of Netflix shows and movies to make discovery easy and fun. You’ll be able to tap to watch the whole show or movie immediately, add it to My List, or share with friends.\nStone wrapped up the presentation by saing, “What’s most exciting to me is how our new TV experience gives us the ability to evolve and innovate more easily going forward. That’s how we’re going to make the Netflix people know even better. And it’s how we’ll continue to connect them with even more shows, movies and games they’ll love.”",
