        "generated_article_body_md": "## Rivian cuts delivery guidance because of Trump’s tariffs and trade wars  \n\nRivian has lowered its vehicle delivery forecast for 2025, attributing the EV delivery cuts to President Trump’s tariffs and regulatory shifts. The company now expects to deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 electric vehicles by year-end, down from earlier projections. This makes Rivian the latest automaker affected by the administration’s economic policies.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThe adjustment highlights how trade policies can disrupt the EV market, particularly for emerging automakers like Rivian. Tariffs on materials and components may increase production costs, delaying growth in an already competitive sector. This development underscores the broader challenge of balancing economic policy with sustainable transportation goals, potentially slowing the transition to electric mobility."
