        "generated_article_body_md": "## Stripe shows iOS developers how to avoid Apple’s App Store commission  \n\nPayments processor Stripe has released documentation to help iOS app developers circumvent Apple’s App Store commission fees. This move comes after a federal judge criticized Apple for failing to comply with a previous ruling requiring the company to allow external payment links in apps. The guidance from Stripe could provide developers with a legal alternative to avoid Apple’s 15-30% transaction fees.  \n\nThe development follows yesterday’s ruling in the Apple-Epic antitrust case, where Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers condemned Apple for not permitting third-party payment options. Stripe’s documentation outlines how developers can integrate external payment systems, potentially reducing costs for both businesses and consumers. While Apple has historically enforced strict in-app purchase rules, this legal pressure may force a shift in its policies.  \n\nBy offering a clear workaround, Stripe is positioning itself as a key ally for developers seeking financial flexibility. The company’s solution could accelerate broader adoption of alternative payment methods on iOS, challenging Apple’s long-standing revenue model."
