        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple ‘iPhone Air’ Rumor Suggests a Bigger Screen Coming in 2027  \nApple’s rumored super-slim iPhone \"Air\" is expected to debut this fall, but supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims development is already underway for a redesigned version with a bigger screen. The second iteration, planned for 2026, will retain the same size before expanding in 2027. Reports suggest Apple initially considered a 6.9-inch display but scaled back to 6.6 inches to avoid structural issues. Additionally, Kuo mentions Apple is working on a second foldable device for 2027, aligning with rumors of staggered iPhone releases.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nIf accurate, this iPhone Air rumor signals Apple’s long-term strategy to refine its ultra-thin smartphone lineup while balancing durability concerns. A larger screen could position the iPhone Air as a premium alternative to the Pro models, catering to users who prioritize portability without sacrificing display size. The mention of a foldable device further suggests Apple is diversifying its iPhone portfolio to compete with rivals like Samsung. Staggered releases could also help Apple maintain consumer interest year-round, rather than relying solely on annual fall launches."
