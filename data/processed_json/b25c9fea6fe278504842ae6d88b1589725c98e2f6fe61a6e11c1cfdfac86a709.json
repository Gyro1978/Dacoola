Failure to comply could result in fines, signaling a tougher stance on digital safety in the latest tech regulation updates.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis move reflects growing global pressure on tech companies to prioritize child safety online. By tightening algorithm controls and enforcing age checks, regulators aim to reduce harmful content exposure for minors. The potential fines underscore the seriousness of these requirements, pushing platforms to adapt quickly or risk financial consequences."
