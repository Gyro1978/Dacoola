Despite numerous attempts to fix this vulnerability—akin to whispering secret commands to override a system—no reliable solution has emerged. Now, Google DeepMind has introduced **CaMeL (CApabilities for MachinE Learning)**, a novel approach that could mark a significant **AI security breakthrough**.  \n\nUnlike previous methods that relied on AI models policing themselves, CaMeL treats language models as inherently untrusted components within a secure software framework. By establishing strict boundaries between user inputs and potentially harmful content, the system prevents unauthorized manipulation. The research paper draws on well-established security principles such as **Control Flow Integrity (CFI), Access Control, and Information Flow Control (IFC)**, adapting decades of software security expertise to the unique challenges of large language models (LLMs).  \n\n### Significance  \nIf successful, CaMeL could provide a long-awaited defense against prompt injection attacks, enhancing the reliability and safety of AI systems in real-world applications. This shift from self-policing models to a structured security framework represents a fundamental change in how AI vulnerabilities are addressed."
