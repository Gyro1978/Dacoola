    "summary": "<p>About a decade ago, Apple and Google started updating iOS and Android, respectively, to make them less susceptible to “juice jacking,” a form of attack that could surreptitiously steal data or execute malicious code when users plug their phones into special-purpose charging hardware. Now, researchers are revealing that, for years, the mitigations have suffered from a fundamental defect that has made them trivial to bypass.</p>\n<p>“Juice jacking” was coined in a <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/08/beware-of-juice-jacking/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2011 article</a> on KrebsOnSecurity detailing an attack demonstrated at a Defcon security conference at the time. Juice jacking works by equipping a charger with hidden hardware that can access files and other internal resources of phones, in much the same way that a computer can when a user connects it to the phone.</p>\n<p>An attacker would then make the chargers available in airports, shopping malls, or other public venues for use by people looking to recharge depleted batteries. While the charger was ostensibly only providing electricity to the phone, it was also secretly downloading files or running malicious code on the device behind the scenes. Starting in 2012, both Apple and Google tried to mitigate the threat by requiring users to click a confirmation button on their phones before a computer—or a computer masquerading as a charger—could access files or execute code on the phone.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/ios-and-android-juice-jacking-defenses-have-been-trivial-to-bypass-for-years/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/ios-and-android-juice-jacking-defenses-have-been-trivial-to-bypass-for-years/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

However, researchers have now disclosed that these protections contained a fundamental flaw, making them easy to bypass for years.  \n\nJuice jacking, first demonstrated at Defcon in 2011, involves modified chargers that secretly access files or run harmful code when users plug in their devices. Attackers often place these rigged chargers in high-traffic public areas like airports and malls, exploiting unsuspecting users. Both Apple and Google attempted to counter this threat by requiring user confirmation before allowing data access, but these measures proved ineffective.  \n\nThe failure of these defenses highlights ongoing risks in public charging scenarios. Despite efforts to secure mobile devices, attackers have continued to exploit this vulnerability, underscoring the need for more robust protections."
