        "generated_article_body_md": "## Amazon-owned Zoox issues recall following robotaxi crash  \n\nZoox, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Amazon, temporarily halted its driverless testing program for over a week and issued a voluntary software recall after one of its unoccupied robotaxis was involved in a crash in Las Vegas on April 8. The company confirmed the incident in a filing with federal safety regulators, though further details about the crash remain undisclosed.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis incident highlights the ongoing challenges facing autonomous vehicle companies as they push toward broader deployment. A recall and testing pause, even for an unoccupied vehicle, could slow Zoox’s progress and invite scrutiny from regulators. Given Amazon’s deep investment in Zoox, any setbacks could also impact broader industry confidence in self-driving technology. While no injuries were reported, such incidents reinforce the need for rigorous safety measures before large-scale adoption."
