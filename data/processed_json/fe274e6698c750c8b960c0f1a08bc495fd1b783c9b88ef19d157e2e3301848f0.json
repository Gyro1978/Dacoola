        "generated_article_body_md": "## OpenAI scraps controversial plan to become for-profit after mounting pressure  \n\nOpenAI has reversed its plan to transition into a for-profit entity, opting instead to remain under the control of its founding nonprofit board. The decision follows criticism and discussions with civic leaders and state attorneys general, as confirmed by CEO Sam Altman in a company blog post. This marks a significant shift from OpenAI’s earlier proposal to restructure as a Public Benefit Corporation, which would have diminished the nonprofit’s influence over operations.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis reversal underscores OpenAI’s commitment to balancing commercial growth with its original mission-driven ethos. The decision reflects growing scrutiny over AI governance and the ethical responsibilities of leading AI developers. By retaining nonprofit oversight, OpenAI aims to prioritize long-term societal impact over unchecked profit motives—a move that could set a precedent for other AI firms navigating similar tensions."
