This follows a recent court ruling that found Google guilty of \"willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power\" in digital advertising. The DOJ's proposal aims to address antitrust concerns by restructuring Google’s dominance in the space.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis move signals a major escalation in regulatory efforts to curb Big Tech’s market control. If enforced, the sale could reshape the digital ad landscape, opening opportunities for competitors and potentially lowering costs for advertisers. The case also sets a precedent for how governments may handle antitrust actions against other dominant tech firms in the future."
