However, the decision still requires regulatory approval before being finalized.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis move signals OpenAIâ€™s commitment to its original mission of ensuring AI benefits humanity, rather than shifting toward a for-profit model. The decision could influence broader discussions around AI governance, as regulatory scrutiny over tech giants intensifies. Maintaining nonprofit control may help OpenAI balance innovation with ethical considerations, but the pending approval highlights ongoing tensions between corporate structure and AI oversight."
