        "generated_article_body_md": "## ARX Robotics Rides Defence Tech Wave with €31M for Battlefield Robots  \n\nGerman defense tech startup ARX Robotics has secured €31 million to scale production of its autonomous battlefield robots, which resemble mini tanks without weaponry. Backed by NATO’s Innovation Fund, the company will also advance its Mithras OS, an AI-powered system designed to retrofit up to 50,000 NATO vehicles with autonomous driving and sensor capabilities. ARX’s CEO, Marc Wietfeld, will discuss the technology at upcoming industry events.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThe funding highlights the growing investment in defense robotics as militaries seek to modernize with AI and automation. ARX’s focus on retrofitting existing NATO vehicles suggests a strategic shift toward cost-effective upgrades rather than entirely new systems. This move could accelerate the adoption of autonomous tech in defense, reducing human risk in combat zones while enhancing operational efficiency. The NATO backing also signals strong institutional support for innovation in military robotics."
