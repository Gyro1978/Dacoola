        "generated_article_body_md": "## Tesla sales continue to slump across Europe despite April EV sales swell  \n\nTesla’s new car sales in Spain dropped 36% year-over-year in April to just 571 vehicles, according to Reuters. The decline reflects a broader trend across Europe, where Tesla sales plunged 37.2% in the first four months of 2025, even as electric vehicle sales from other brands rose in Spain.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nTesla’s declining market share in Europe highlights growing competition in the EV sector, where legacy automakers and new entrants are gaining traction. The slump suggests Tesla may be losing its early-mover advantage, particularly in markets with strong local competitors. While the broader EV market is expanding, Tesla’s struggles could signal pricing, supply chain, or brand perception challenges that need addressing to regain momentum."
