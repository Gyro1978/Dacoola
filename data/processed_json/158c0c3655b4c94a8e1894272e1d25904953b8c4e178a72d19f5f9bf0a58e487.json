        "generated_article_body_md": "## The FDA Just Approved the First CRISPR-Edited Pigs for Food  \n\nThe FDA has approved the first **CRISPR-edited pigs** for human consumption, developed by PIC. These pigs are engineered to be highly resistant to a harmful virus affecting global pig populations. This marks a significant step in the commercialization of gene-edited livestock.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis approval signals a major shift in food technology, as CRISPR-edited animals move closer to mainstream agriculture. By making pigs resistant to a devastating virus, the innovation could reduce livestock losses, lower production costs, and improve food security. However, it also raises questions about regulatory oversight and public acceptance of gene-edited meat. The decision could pave the way for more CRISPR-modified food products in the future."
