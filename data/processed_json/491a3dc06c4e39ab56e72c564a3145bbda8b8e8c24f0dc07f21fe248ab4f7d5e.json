A lot. And so, when I asked her what one of her favorite gadgets was, she said it was her Brother 1034D Serger. If you’re not quite sure what a serger is (I certainly wasn’t), read on.</em><br /><br /><strong>What exactly is a thread serger?</strong><br />A serger, also known as an overlocker, is a type of sewing machine generally used in apparel making. It has two needles and uses up to four strands of thread at a time to create the loops and finished edge you see on the inside of most knitwear, like T-shirts and leggings. It also has a knife that cuts the edge of your fabric at the same time, so the finished product looks clean and professional.<br /><br /><strong>When did you buy this one, and what went into the decision?</strong><br />I bought this one this past March as a birthday and tax return present. I’ve been wanting one for a while, because I sew a lot of clothes. I’m picky about style and, being fat, have a hard time finding clothes I like that actually fit me. I also love wearing knits because they’re comfortable, and traditional sewing machines aren’t intended primarily to sew knit garments, which need to have stretchy seams. You can use a zigzag stitch to achieve a stretch in your seam, but the serger sews and cuts all at once, as well as finishes the inside edges, so it saves a lot of time. <br /><br />In choosing a serger, I wanted one that was easy to thread, had an adjustable free arm for sewing cuffs and sleeves, and could sew multiple layers of fabric at a time. I watched a bunch of YouTube reviews of sergers and found this one to be pretty affordable — and it checked my boxes. It also got better reviews than its cheaper sibling, the DX. I was intimidated by it at first because four spools of thread is kind of scary. But it has clearly labeled and color-coded instructions for threading and comes with a manual, so I learned it and had it down in under half an hour.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/257725_Serger_photos__CVirginia__0005_3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br /><br /><strong>What do you usually create with it?</strong><br />So far, I have hemmed a couple shirts and made a maxi skirt (with pockets!) and a crop top. That was after a long and frustrating period trying to learn how to use it. I also dulled two different knives, learning that you can’t sew over pins with a serger because there is a big metal knife chopping your seam off.<br /><br /><strong>What do you like about it?</strong><br />Sometimes when you’re sewing knits on a traditional (lockstitch) machine, the edges become unintentionally ruffle-y (due to its one measly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_dog\">feed dog</a>, which is the moveable plate that pulls the material through from stitch to stitch). This can make your piece look pretty weird and bad. Another great thing about this serger is that it has something called differential feed, which uses two feed dogs to sew your fabric together. It can be adjusted to feed one piece of fabric faster or slower, so it will flatten out your wobbly knitted seams or can be used to create a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce_hem\">lettuce hem</a>. It also <a href=\"https://www.brother-usa.com/products/sa213?srsltid=AfmBOopEGFIn8fC8cY6lgeq1bni0EqByl3CSlD8pcALjM2sCnQmoHFXt\">comes with a gathering foot</a>, which can be used to gather and sew (intentional) ruffles!<br /><br /><strong>Is there anything about it that you dislike or that you think could be improved?</strong><br />This is actually on me for not doing quite enough research, but when I bought it, I was excited to finally be able to do the coveted two-thread <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverstitch\">coverstitch</a> you see on the hems of T-shirts and other knit stuff, only to find out you <em>actually need a whole other machine that literally only does that one thing. </em>That was disappointing to find out, but to compensate, the serger does actually come with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_stitch\">blind hem foot</a> that you can use to do an okay impression of one. It’s kind of a finicky stitch to get right, though, because you’re sewing from the wrong side of the fabric, and I had to do quite a few samples to test it out before I used it on any garments. <br /><br /><strong>Who would you recommend it to?</strong><br />If you sew a lot of knitwear clothing, it can be a really useful tool for leveling up your garments and being a bit more efficient! It’s not a total replacement for a lockstitch sewing machine but I’m really liking it so far. Don’t be too intimidated by the four threads: they are your friends. And don’t try to sew over any of your pins. </p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><br /></p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Why I Love My Brother 1034D Serger  \n\nCath Virginia, a senior designer at *The Verge*, swears by her Brother 1034D Serger for sewing knitwear. Unlike traditional sewing machines, this serger uses four threads and a built-in knife to create clean, stretchable seams—ideal for T-shirts, leggings, and other knit garments. Virginia highlights its ease of use, adjustable free arm, and differential feed system, which prevents fabric ruffling. Though initially intimidated by threading four spools, she mastered it quickly thanks to clear instructions.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThe Brother 1034D Serger exemplifies how specialized tools can elevate craftsmanship, especially for those sewing stretchy fabrics. Its efficiency—cutting and finishing seams in one pass—saves time, while features like differential feed ensure professional results. For hobbyists and professionals alike, investing in a serger like this can bridge the gap between homemade and store-bought quality. However, as Virginia notes, it’s not a replacement for a traditional sewing machine, emphasizing the importance of choosing tools tailored to specific needs."
