As you can see above, it’s roughly 6.5 centimeters (2.6in) wide and maybe 9mm tall.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/GqHk7UMXcAAVqLG.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While we don’t have much in the way of all-important specs like video resolution and framerate, we can see it has three buttons including power, recording, and menu controls, plus a tap-and-swipe touchscreen, and it uses interchangeable 7.55Wh batteries that look like those for DJI’s Osmo Action series.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://x.com/hakasushi/status/1918814059534659792\">According to the quick start guide</a>, the “OQ001” model has microSD storage, a USB-C charge port, Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1, and it can physically mount “various accessories” — intriguingly, the unit’s tripod mount seems to have four copper contacts surrounding it, perhaps to let an accessory provide power or data. </p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/GqFgbuVXkAA17gk.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408\" title=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Internally, the teardown shows that DJI mounts its camera sensors the same way as Insta360. Instead of having a sensor directly facing each lens, the light first bounces off a 45-degree mirror.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Actually, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/insta360?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#insta360</a> uses the same 45° mirror principle (X3 on this example on top).  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/djiosmo360?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#djiosmo360</a> at the bottom <a href=\"https://t.co/0P9QysoyB5\">pic.twitter.com/0P9QysoyB5</a></p>— hakasushi (@hakasushi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hakasushi/status/1918828692530167945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 4, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hakasushi has published quite a <a href=\"https://x.com/hakasushi/status/1919043845402058952\">few other teardown photos too</a>, but says the internals might change, as this one appears to be a prototype. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unusually, <a href=\"https://dronexl.co/2025/05/04/dji-osmo-360-leaked-but-is-dji-too-late/?fsp_sid=12353\">DJI leaker Jasper Ellens speculates that DJI may not bring this camera to market</a>, particularly not in the United States, as word (and leaks) would usually have reached him by now if it were. “I can’t find any early leaks on web stores, multiple sources never received it and therefore it’s even a better hidden secret than the <a href=\"https://dronexl.co/drone-companies/dji/dji-mavic-4/\">DJI M</a>a<a href=\"https://dronexl.co/drone-companies/dji/dji-mavic-4/\">vic 4</a> or DJI Mini 5,” he writes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then again, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/drone/606008/dji-interview-us-ban-no-more-no-fly-zone-geofencing\">DJI is living</a> in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/659791/dji-osmo-pocket-3-price-hike-tariffs\">unprecedented times</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div></div></div>\n</div></figure>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Leak: Here is DJI’s first 360-degree camera  \n\nA prototype of DJI’s first 360-degree camera, the **Osmo 360**, has been leaked online, revealing key details before an official announcement. Shared by leakers Hakasushi and Igor Bogdanov, the images show a compact, square-shaped dual-lens camera with a touchscreen, interchangeable batteries, and a tripod mount featuring copper contacts. The device includes Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, and microSD storage, though critical specs like resolution remain unknown. Internally, it mirrors Insta360’s design, using 45-degree mirrors to redirect light to the sensors. However, some speculate DJI may not release it, especially in the U.S., due to unusually tight secrecy.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis **DJI 360 camera leak** suggests the company is entering a competitive market dominated by Insta360 and GoPro. If launched, the Osmo 360 could shake up the 360-camera space with DJI’s reputation for high-quality imaging tech. The compact design and modular accessories hint at versatility, appealing to creators. However, DJI’s silence and geopolitical challenges raise doubts about its release. For now, the leak offers a tantalizing glimpse into DJI’s potential expansion beyond drones and action cams."
