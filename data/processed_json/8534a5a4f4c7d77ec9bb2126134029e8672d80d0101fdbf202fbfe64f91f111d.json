You pull up ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, type in your prompt, and whatever it spits out is for your eyes only - unless you take a screenshot and terrorize the world by posting your AI experiments online. But not with <a href=\"https://www.meta.ai/\">the Meta AI site</a>. Here, you can share your AI results with just two clicks.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The result is a fascinating microcosm of the human-AI experience and, specifically, how so few people know what to do with generative AI. The irony is that Meta VP of product Connor Hayes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/657645/meta-ai-app-chatgpt-competitor-release-ios-android\">told <em>The Verge</em></a> the company added the whole social aspect to show AI newbies what they can use it for.</p>\n<img alt=\"Screenshot of Meta AI social feed that shows an AI-generated image of Gary Vee yelling at an old man.\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-02-at-3.55.40%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,8.7204211986062,100,82.559157602788\" title=\"Screenshot of Meta AI social feed that shows an AI-generated image of Gary Vee yelling at an old man.\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scroll the feed, and you'll find an odd assortment of Pinterest-like cards. The vast majority are experiments with image generation, some are simple queries, and a few feature folks experimenting with AI gotchas (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/how-many-rs-in-strawberry-this-ai-cant-tell-you.html\">how many letter Rs are there in the word strawberry</a>?).

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Meta’s AI app is a nightmarish social feed  \n\nMeta’s new AI app combines the visual clutter of Pinterest with the worst aspects of Threads, topped with AI-generated prompts. Unlike private AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Meta AI allows users to share their AI-generated results publicly with just two clicks. The feed is filled with bizarre experiments, from AI-generated images to trivial queries, highlighting how users struggle to find meaningful uses for generative AI. Meta’s VP of product claims the social aspect is meant to inspire AI newcomers—but the result is a chaotic, often nonsensical experience.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis Meta AI app critique underscores a growing tension in AI adoption: while companies push for broader engagement, many users still treat AI as a novelty rather than a tool. The feed’s randomness reflects the broader confusion around generative AI’s practical applications. If Meta wants to position its AI as useful, it may need to rethink how it encourages meaningful interaction—otherwise, the platform risks becoming a digital curiosity cabinet rather than a productivity enhancer."
