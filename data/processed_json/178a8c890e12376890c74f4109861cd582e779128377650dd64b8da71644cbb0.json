The launch took place at 11:15 (CEST) today from Europe’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.  Now in orbit, the first-of-its-kind satellite will deploy a radar antenna that looks like a giant space umbrella. Developed by US defence contractor L3 Harris, the antenna is so intricate that it will take nine days to unfold in orbit. The umbrella’s job is to direct radar pulses from a P-band radar instrument mounted on the satellite’s body down to the forests below.

The satellite features a massive radar antenna, resembling a space umbrella, designed by US defense contractor L3 Harris. This first-of-its-kind **space radar satellite** will take nine days to fully deploy its intricate antenna, which will direct P-band radar pulses to Earth’s forests, gathering critical climate data.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis mission marks a significant advancement in climate science, as the Biomass satellite will provide unprecedented insights into global forest biomass—a key factor in carbon storage and climate change. The P-band radar’s ability to penetrate dense foliage allows for more accurate forest monitoring than ever before. The data collected could refine climate models and inform global conservation efforts, reinforcing ESA’s role in pioneering Earth observation technologies."
