        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple files appeal to wrest back control of its App Store  \n\nApple has filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit, challenging a recent court ruling that prevents the company from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store. The decision stems from the ongoing *Epic v. Apple* lawsuit, which initially barred Apple from blocking developers from directing users to alternative payment methods. Last week, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Apple violated a previous court order and even referred Apple’s VP of Finance for potential perjury charges.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis appeal marks a critical moment in Apple’s fight to maintain control over its lucrative App Store ecosystem. If upheld, the lower court’s ruling could significantly impact Apple’s revenue model, forcing the company to allow more payment alternatives and reducing its 15-30% commission on in-app purchases. The case also highlights growing regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech’s dominance, setting a precedent for future antitrust battles in the digital marketplace."
