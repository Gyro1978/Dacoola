        "generated_article_body_md": "## May Mobility to launch robotaxis on Uber platform this year in Texas  \n\nMay Mobility, a startup specializing in autonomous vehicle technology, is set to deploy its robotaxis on Uber’s ride-hailing platform by the end of 2025. The initial rollout will take place in Arlington, Texas, as part of a multi-year partnership between the two companies. This autonomous vehicles partnership represents a strategic expansion for May Mobility, which has primarily focused on providing shuttle services within campuses and planned communities.  \n\nThe collaboration with Uber offers May Mobility a significant opportunity to scale its operations beyond its traditional markets. For Uber, the addition of May Mobility’s autonomous vehicles strengthens its growing portfolio of mobility solutions. The partnership aligns with Uber’s broader strategy to integrate self-driving technology into its platform, enhancing efficiency and reducing operational costs.  \n\nWhile the initial deployment is limited to Arlington, the long-term agreement suggests potential expansion to other regions. The move could accelerate the adoption of autonomous ride-hailing services, particularly in urban areas where demand for convenient and sustainable transportation is rising."
