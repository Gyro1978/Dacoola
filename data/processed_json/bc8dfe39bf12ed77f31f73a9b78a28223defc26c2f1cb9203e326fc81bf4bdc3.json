        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple says most US-bound iPhones no longer made in China  \n\nApple has revealed that the majority of iPhones destined for the US market are no longer manufactured in China, citing US tariffs as a key factor. The company estimates these tariffs will add approximately $900 million to its costs this quarter, signaling a significant iPhone manufacturing shift in its supply chain strategy.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis move highlights the growing impact of geopolitical tensions and trade policies on global tech production. By diversifying its manufacturing base, Apple may be mitigating risks associated with US-China trade disputes, but the added costs could influence pricing or profit margins. The shift also reflects broader industry trends toward supply chain resilience, as companies seek alternatives to heavy reliance on Chinese production."
