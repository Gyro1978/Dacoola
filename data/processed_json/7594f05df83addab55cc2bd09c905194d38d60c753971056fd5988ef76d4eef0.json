        "generated_article_body_md": "## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Deploys Thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for Agentic AI and Reasoning Models  \n\nOracle has launched its first wave of liquid-cooled **NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs deployment**, specifically the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 racks, in its data centers. These high-performance GPUs are now available for customer use on NVIDIA DGX Cloud and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), enabling the development and execution of advanced reasoning models and AI agents. The deployment includes cutting-edge networking solutions like NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand and Spectrum-X Ethernet, ensuring scalable, low-latency performance for AI workloads.  \n\nOCI is among the first cloud providers to deploy NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems, with plans to expand into one of the world’s largest Blackwell clusters, scaling beyond 100,000 GPUs. This expansion aims to meet the surging demand for AI inference tokens and accelerated computing. The new infrastructure leverages the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 platform, combining 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs per rack, delivering exceptional efficiency for agentic AI applications.  \n\n### Significance  \nOCI’s deployment marks a major step in transforming cloud data centers into AI factories capable of producing intelligence at scale. With flexible deployment options across public, government, and sovereign clouds, as well as customer-owned data centers, OCI is positioning itself as a leader in AI infrastructure. Major enterprises and government agencies are already planning to utilize these systems for AI-driven projects, reinforcing the growing reliance on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for next-generation AI workloads."
