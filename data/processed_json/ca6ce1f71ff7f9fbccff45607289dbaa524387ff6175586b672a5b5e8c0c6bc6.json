        "generated_article_body_md": "## Tesla’s \"Robotaxi\" Trademark Rejected by USPTO for Being Too Generic  \n\nTesla’s attempt to trademark the term “Robotaxi” for its autonomous ride-hailing service has been refused by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for being too generic. The USPTO issued a nonfinal office action, giving Tesla three months to respond before the application is abandoned. The agency ruled that the term is merely descriptive and already used by competitors in the industry. However, a separate Tesla application for the “Robotaxi” trademark covering ride-hailing services remains under review.  \n\nTesla filed the trademark applications in October 2024, coinciding with the unveiling of its Cybercab—a purpose-built electric vehicle for autonomous ride-hailing. The rejected application pertains to land vehicles and structural parts, while the pending one focuses on transportation services.  \n\n### Why the USPTO Rejected Tesla’s Trademark  \n\nThe USPTO examiner found no conflicting trademarks but deemed “Robotaxi” too generic to qualify for exclusive branding rights. The term is widely used in the autonomous vehicle sector, making it difficult for Tesla to claim proprietary ownership. The examiner noted that competitors also use variations like “ROBO,” “ROBOT,” or “ROBOTIC” for similar services.  \n\nTesla now has an opportunity to submit additional evidence, such as marketing materials, brochures, and website screenshots, to prove that “Robotaxi” is uniquely associated with its brand. If unsuccessful, Tesla may need to rebrand its autonomous ride-hailing initiative.  \n\n#### What’s Next for Tesla’s Autonomous Ride-Hailing Plans?  \n\nDespite the setback, Tesla continues developing its autonomous ride-hailing service, with the Cybercab expected to play a central role. The pending “Robotaxi” trademark application for transportation services could still be approved, allowing Tesla to use the term commercially. However, the company may need to differentiate its branding to avoid further legal hurdles.  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n\n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Why was Tesla’s \"Robotaxi\" trademark rejected?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>The USPTO ruled the term \"Robotaxi\" is too generic and already used by competitors, making it ineligible for exclusive trademark protection.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Can Tesla still use the \"Robotaxi\" name?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Yes, but without trademark protection, competitors could also use the term. Tesla may need to rebrand or strengthen its case with additional evidence.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n</div>"
