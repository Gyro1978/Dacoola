        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple appeals decision that forced it to allow links to external payments in apps  \n\nApple has officially filed an appeal against a recent court ruling requiring it to open the App Store to external payment mechanisms. The decision stems from its legal battle with Epic Games, where Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers criticized Apple for not complying with the court’s earlier order to freely permit alternative payment links.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis appeal underscores Apple’s determination to maintain control over its App Store ecosystem, which generates significant revenue through its 15-30% commission on in-app purchases. If Apple loses, it could set a precedent for other developers to bypass its payment system, potentially disrupting its business model. The case also highlights the broader regulatory scrutiny facing Big Tech over antitrust concerns, with implications for how app marketplaces operate globally."
