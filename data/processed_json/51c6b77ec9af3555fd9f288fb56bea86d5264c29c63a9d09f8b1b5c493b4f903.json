However, the issue seems to go beyond that, affecting almost any app for Roku TVs, suggest user comments on the thread over the last week. The problem appears to be tied to a recent Roku software update.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A community moderator called RokuEmmanuel-D writes in an update from Thursday that the company is “investigating the Disney Plus HDR content that was washed out after the recent update,” and asks for community members to share examples and details about what content is being affected, which model of TV they have, and what software version they’re on. </p>\n\n<div class=\"c-image-slider alignnone wp-block-vox-media-image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"c-image-slider__caption\">\n\t\t\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Washed-out-Andor.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" title=\"\" />\n\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Good-Andor.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" title=\"\" />\n\n\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first several comments only report the problem in Disney Plus, and only on TCL TVs, with users saying that app menus and that colors are okay in non-HDR content. But as <a href=\"https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/m-p/1068782/highlight/true#M8211\">one user shows</a> in the above images of Disney Plus show <em>Andor</em> taken from two different TVs, <a href=\"https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/m-p/1068784/highlight/true#M8212\">normally-vibrant colors</a> have instead taken on a <a href=\"https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/m-p/1068782/highlight/true#M8211\">gray-ish pall</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Later comments report the same problems with YouTube TV, Netflix, Apple TV Plus, Amazon Prime Video, and others. One said they saw the issue with their <a href=\"https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/td-p/1071118/highlight/true/page/3#:~:text=to%20RSS%20Feed-,Permalink,-Print\">Hisense-branded Roku TV</a>, rather than a TCL model. The same person reported HDR working fine over HDMI <a href=\"https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/m-p/1070977/highlight/true#M8363\">from their PS5</a>, while another said the signal from their <a href=\"https://community.roku.com/t5/Issue-Tracking-Board/Under-investigation-Disney-Plus-Washed-out-colors-on-content-after-recent-update/m-p/1071741/highlight/true#M8377\">4K Blu-Ray player</a> looked good, implying the issue is limited to Roku streaming, rather than any deeper TV firmware issues. People in the thread said their TVs — Hisense and TCL — were on <a href=\"https://support.roku.com/article/228844467\">Roku software version 14.5</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Washed-out or flat colors can already be an issue when watching HDR content on a TV that’s not bright enough to produce a good HDR image — that was the reason I turned the feature off the old, cheap TCL Roku TV I once owned. But these reports describe something beyond that, with Roku producing desaturated, almost black-and-white images when HDR is on. It’s unclear how widespread the problem is, but there are recent Reddit threads that seem to fit the bill, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1k8xw4o/how_to_get_a_decent_picture_on_netflix/\">mentioning grayish</a> or <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1juhrxu/apps_in_color_but_played_media_is_black_and_white/\">black-and-white picture</a> that doesn’t affect streaming app menus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Roku didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment. </p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Roku is looking into complaints about washed-out HDR streams  \n\nRoku is investigating user reports of washed-out colors when streaming HDR content, primarily on Disney Plus but also affecting other apps like Netflix, YouTube TV, and Apple TV Plus. The issue appears linked to a recent software update (version 14.5) and has been reported on TCL and Hisense Roku TVs. Users describe desaturated, grayish, or even black-and-white images in HDR mode, though non-HDR content remains unaffected. Roku has acknowledged the problem and is gathering details from affected users.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nHDR (High Dynamic Range) is a key selling point for modern streaming devices, promising richer colors and deeper contrasts. If a widespread software bug is degrading HDR performance, it could undermine user trust in Roku’s platform, especially since the issue spans multiple apps and TV models. The fact that external HDMI sources (like PS5 or Blu-ray players) display HDR correctly suggests the problem lies in Roku’s streaming software rather than the TVs themselves. A swift fix will be crucial to prevent further frustration among users who rely on Roku for premium streaming experiences."
