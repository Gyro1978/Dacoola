Manufacturing Is Keeping It Alive  \n\nWhile consumer-focused metaverse visions like Mark Zuckerberg’s VR meetings struggle, the **industrial metaverse** is gaining traction by merging digital and physical worlds in practical ways. Unlike speculative social applications, industrial uses—such as manufacturing and logistics—are demonstrating real-world value through enhanced efficiency and collaboration.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThe shift toward industrial applications highlights a broader trend: technology often finds its most impactful uses in enterprise settings before reaching consumers. By focusing on tangible benefits like streamlined production and predictive maintenance, the industrial metaverse could redefine how industries operate, proving that the metaverse’s true potential lies beyond entertainment and social interaction."
