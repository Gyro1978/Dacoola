        "generated_article_body_md": "## Signal Clone Used by Trump Official Stops Operations After Report It Was Hacked  \n\nA messaging service used by former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz has temporarily shut down after reports of a **messaging app hack**. The app, a modified version of Signal provided by Israeli company TeleMessage, was compromised, exposing direct and group messages. TeleMessage, recently acquired by Smarsh, confirmed the shutdown while investigating the breach. The hacker reportedly stole data from modified versions of Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat used by government clients.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis incident highlights the risks of third-party messaging solutions, especially those tailored for government use. While Signal is known for its strong encryption, modified versions like TeleMessage’s may introduce vulnerabilities. The breach raises concerns about sensitive communications being exposed, particularly given the app’s use by high-profile officials. It also underscores the need for stricter security audits in government-contracted software, as even \"secure\" platforms can become weak links when altered."
