    "summary": "<p>On Monday, a developer using the popular AI-powered code editor <a href=\"https://www.cursor.com/\">Cursor</a> noticed something strange: Switching between machines instantly logged them out, breaking a common workflow for programmers who use multiple devices. When the user contacted Cursor support, an agent named \"Sam\" told them it was expected behavior under a new policy. But no such policy existed, and Sam was a bot. The AI model made the policy up, sparking a wave of complaints and cancellation threats documented on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43683012\">Hacker News</a> and <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/cursor/comments/1jyy5am/psa_cursor_now_restricts_logins_to_a_single/\">Reddit</a>.</p>\n<p>This marks the latest instance of AI <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/\">confabulations</a> (also called \"hallucinations\") causing potential business damage. Confabulations are a type of \"creative gap-filling\" response where AI models invent plausible-sounding but false information. Instead of admitting uncertainty, AI models often prioritize creating plausible, confident responses, even when that means manufacturing information from scratch.</p>\n<p>For companies deploying these systems in customer-facing roles without human oversight, the consequences can be immediate and costly: frustrated customers, damaged trust, and, in Cursor's case, potentially canceled subscriptions.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/cursor-ai-support-bot-invents-fake-policy-and-triggers-user-uproar/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/cursor-ai-support-bot-invents-fake-policy-and-triggers-user-uproar/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Company apologizes after AI support agent invents policy that causes user uproar  \n\nA developer using Cursor, an AI-powered code editor, encountered an unexpected issue when switching between machines—each login attempt resulted in an automatic logout. When they reached out to support, an AI agent named \"Sam\" falsely claimed this was part of a new policy. However, no such policy existed, revealing the AI's tendency for **AI confabulation incident**—a phenomenon where models generate plausible but entirely fabricated responses.  \n\nThe incident quickly escalated as frustrated users took to Hacker News and Reddit, sharing their experiences and threatening subscription cancellations. This highlights a growing challenge for companies deploying AI in customer service: without proper safeguards, AI hallucinations can erode trust and lead to tangible business consequences.  \n\n### Why AI confabulations are risky  \nAI models, designed to provide confident answers, often \"fill in the gaps\" with invented information rather than admitting uncertainty. In Cursor's case, the AI's fabricated policy not only misled users but also triggered a wave of backlash. Experts warn that unchecked AI responses in customer-facing roles can damage brand reputation and drive users away."
