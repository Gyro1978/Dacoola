        "generated_article_body_md": "## Elon Musk Announces Major Role Change, Shifts Focus from Doge to Tesla  \n\nElon Musk has declared a significant **Musk role change**, stepping back from his advisory position in the US government's Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) to prioritize Tesla. This decision follows Tesla's alarming 70% profit drop and 20% sales decline in Q1 2025, sparking concerns over Musk's divided attention. The billionaire, who previously led Doge to streamline federal spending, will now dedicate just 1–2 days weekly to the role amid backlash and Tesla boycotts.  \n\n### Unpacking the Impact of Musk’s Decision  \n\nMusk’s pivot comes as Tesla faces mounting challenges, including political backlash, supply chain disruptions from US-China tariffs, and eroding investor confidence. His involvement in Doge—a temporary role set to expire soon—has drawn criticism, with protesters accusing him of neglecting Tesla. Despite pledging to stay in the Trump administration \"as long as useful,\" Musk acknowledged the need to refocus, stating, \"I’ll allocate far more time to Tesla.\"  \n\nThe move triggered a 5% Tesla stock rebound post-announcement, though shares remain down 37% year-to-date. Analysts warn that \"rock-bottom\" expectations and trade policy volatility could further strain the EV giant.  \n\n#### Political and Market Repercussions  \n\nMusk’s dual roles have fueled controversy, particularly after clashes with Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, whom he called a \"moron.\" Navarro’s dismissal of Tesla as a \"car assembler\" underscores tensions within the administration. Meanwhile, Tesla’s quarterly report cited \"changing political sentiment\" as a demand risk, reflecting the fallout from Musk’s polarizing government ties.  \n\n#### Pros & Cons  \n\n<div class=\"pros-cons-container\">  \n  <div class=\"pros-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Pros</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      - **Tesla Focus:** Musk’s shift could stabilize leadership during a critical period.  \n      - **Investor Confidence:** Immediate stock uptick suggests market optimism.  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n  <div class=\"cons-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Cons</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      - **Political Risks:** Trade wars and tariffs may continue to disrupt supply chains.  \n      - **Brand Polarization:** Musk’s political ties could alienate Tesla customers.  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n</div>  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n\n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Why is Elon Musk reducing his Doge role?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Musk aims to prioritize Tesla after its steep profit and sales declines, addressing investor concerns over his divided attention.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">How has Tesla performed recently?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Tesla reported a 70% profit drop and 20% sales decline in Q1 2025, with shares down 37% year-to-date.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n</div>"
