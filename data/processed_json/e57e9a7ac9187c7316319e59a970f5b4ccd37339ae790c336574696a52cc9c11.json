While tokenization differences are known, limited analysis exists on how these variations impact token counts and pricing. Early findings suggest Claude models could be 20-30% more expensive than GPT for enterprise users due to these discrepancies.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nTokenization directly influences API pricing, as many AI providers charge per token. A less efficient tokenizer means more tokens—and higher costs—for the same input. Enterprises scaling AI deployments must factor in these hidden expenses when choosing models. This revelation could push vendors to optimize tokenization or adjust pricing models to remain competitive."
