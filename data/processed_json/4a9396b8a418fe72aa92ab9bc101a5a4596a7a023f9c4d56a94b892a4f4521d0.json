        "generated_article_body_md": "## AI in Legal Sentencing: Arizona Case Tests Boundaries  \n\nThree years after Chris Pelkey was killed in a road rage shooting, his voice returned to an Arizona courtroom—through artificial intelligence. At the sentencing of his killer, Gabriel Horcasitas, an AI-generated version of Pelkey delivered a victim impact statement, marking one of the first known uses of the technology in a U.S. legal proceeding.  \n\nThe AI reconstruction, created from Pelkey’s voice recordings and videos, spoke words written by his sister, Stacey Wales, who aimed to reflect his forgiving nature. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends,\" the digital Pelkey told Horcasitas, who received a 10.5-year manslaughter sentence. While the judge praised the approach, legal experts are divided on whether this sets a responsible precedent or opens ethical risks.  \n\n### The Case and Its Implications  \n\nThe use of AI in Pelkey’s sentencing highlights both the potential and pitfalls of integrating emerging technology into legal systems. Arizona courts have already experimented with AI to simplify rulings for public understanding, but this case pushed further—allowing a victim’s posthumous \"participation\" in court.  \n\nJudge Todd Lang, who presided over the case, endorsed the AI statement, calling it \"genuine\" and noting its emotional impact. Legal scholars like Paul Grimm, a retired federal judge, see such applications as inevitable. \"The technology is irresistible,\" Grimm told the BBC. However, critics like Carnegie Mellon’s Derek Leben warn that not all AI recreations may align with a victim’s true wishes, raising concerns about misuse.  \n\n#### Pros & Cons  \n<div class=\"pros-cons-container\">  \n  <div class=\"pros-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Pros</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      <ul>  \n        <li>**Emotional Closure:** Allows families to convey a victim’s perspective in their own voice.</li>  \n        <li>**Judicial Efficiency:** Streamlines victim impact statements when direct testimony isn’t possible.</li>  \n      </ul>  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n  <div class=\"cons-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Cons</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      <ul>  \n        <li>**Ethical Risks:** AI reconstructions may misrepresent a victim’s true sentiments.</li>  \n        <li>**Legal Precedent:** Could lead to unregulated or manipulative uses in courtrooms.</li>  \n      </ul>  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n</div>  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">How was the AI version of Chris Pelkey created? <i class=\"faq-icon fas fa-chevron-down\"></i></summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Pelkey’s family used his voice recordings, videos, and photos to train an AI model, which then delivered a script written by his sister.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Why are some experts concerned about AI in legal sentencing? <i class=\"faq-icon fas fa-chevron-down\"></i></summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Critics worry AI could distort victims’ voices or be exploited to sway judges and juries unfairly.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Has AI been used in other court proceedings? <i class=\"faq-icon fas fa-chevron-down\"></i></summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Yes, Arizona’s Supreme Court uses AI to simplify legal rulings, but this case is among the first to apply it to victim statements.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n</div>"
