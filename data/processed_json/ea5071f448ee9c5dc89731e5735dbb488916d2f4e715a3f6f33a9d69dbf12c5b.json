On Wednesday, Anthropic reaffirmed its backing of the \"Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion,\" a policy set to impose broad restrictions on exporting AI chips starting May 15. The move underscores Anthropic’s alignment with government efforts to regulate advanced semiconductor technology.  \n\nThe following day, Nvidia issued a sharp rebuttal, presenting a contrasting perspective on the proposed export controls. While the specifics of Nvidia’s response remain undisclosed, the company’s stance reflects its vested interest in maintaining global market access for its AI hardware. The disagreement highlights the tension between regulatory oversight and commercial interests in the rapidly evolving AI sector.  \n\nAs the May 15 deadline approaches, the debate over **AI chip export controls** could intensify, with major industry players weighing in on the economic and strategic implications. The outcome may shape future policies governing semiconductor trade and AI development."
