        "generated_article_body_md": "## US Sets Tariffs of Up to 3,521% on South East Asia Solar Panels  \nThe US has imposed new tariffs as high as 3,521% on solar panels imported from South East Asia, targeting Chinese manufacturers with factories in the region. The move could significantly impact several companies relying on these production hubs to bypass existing trade restrictions.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nThese extreme tariffs reflect the US’s ongoing efforts to reduce dependence on Chinese-dominated solar supply chains. By penalizing companies that shifted production to South East Asia to avoid earlier tariffs, the US aims to bolster domestic solar manufacturing. However, such high duties could disrupt solar project costs and timelines, potentially slowing the country’s renewable energy transition."
