    "summary": "<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"The latest iPad Mini standing up on a table.\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/iPad-Mini-Deal-Lead.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s true that Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review\">latest iPad</a> remains an excellent value, especially when it’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZ75TN5F/\">on sale for $299</a>. However, if you want features like Apple Intelligence and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146454/apple-pencil-pro-ipad-stylus-price-availability-features\">Apple Pencil Pro support</a> without spending a fortune on an iPad Pro, the <strong>latest iPad Mini</strong> might be the better option. That’s especially true now given Apple’s smallest tablet is matching its all-time low at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3YF38G\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-ipad-mini-a17-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578253.p\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-128gb-2024-space-gray/-/A-85966283\">Target</a>, where you can grab the base configuration with Wi-Fi starting at around $399 ($100 off).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Apple’s smallest iPad, the 8.3-inch Mini is more portable than its larger siblings, making it a great travel companion. It’s easy to hold with one hand and offers all-day battery life, rendering it an even better value if you read a lot. It also delivers good performance courtesy of its A17 Pro chip, so you can stream Netflix, shoot emails, play games, and even make video calls with ease (even if the camera is still awkwardly placed while using the tablet in landscape mode). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As mentioned previously, the seventh-gen Mini also provides access to Apple’s growing suite of AI-powered features, which don’t quite live up to the hype but are starting to become more useful with time. This includes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji\">ChatGPT integration</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/639849/apple-ios-18-4-intelligence-priority-notifications\">priority notifications</a>, along with tools for proofreading, summarizing messages, enhancing photos, and even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175523/apple-ai-custom-emoji-images-ios18-wwdc\">creating your own custom emojis and images</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s more, if you own an Apple Pencil Pro, you can play around with a host of creative features that aren’t available on the entry-level Apple Pencil with USB-C, like double-tap tool switching. You can also leverage FindMy support, should you ever misplace your stylus, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24194423/math-notes-ipad-ios-18-calculator-app\">solve math problems</a> by writing them out. That’s in addition to a host of other iPadOS 18 features, the bulk of which don’t require a stylus.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review\"><strong>Read our full iPad Mini (2024) review</strong></a>.</h5>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple’s latest iPad Mini has dropped to its lowest price in months  \n\nApple’s latest iPad Mini is now available for $399, matching its all-time low at major retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Target—a $100 discount. The 8.3-inch tablet, powered by the A17 Pro chip, offers portability, all-day battery life, and access to Apple Intelligence features like ChatGPT integration, priority notifications, and AI-powered photo enhancements. It also supports the Apple Pencil Pro, enabling creative tools like double-tap switching and FindMy tracking.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis price drop makes the iPad Mini a compelling alternative to pricier iPad Pro models, especially for users who prioritize portability and AI capabilities. The discount, combined with its performance and feature set, positions it as a strong mid-range option for students, travelers, and creatives. With Apple’s ecosystem expanding, the Mini’s affordability could drive adoption among budget-conscious buyers seeking premium functionality."
