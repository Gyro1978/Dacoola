    "summary": "<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"The Buffalo Skeleton Hard Disk pictured from the front and back against a gradient background.\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/buffalo_skeleton_harddisk_drive.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption>The Buffalo Skeleton Hard Disk puts the inner workings of a 4TB hard drive on display. | Image: Buffalo</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To help celebrate the 50 years its parent company has been in business, Japan’s Buffalo has announced a limited edition external hard drive with a window that lets you see its inner workings. Don’t whip out your credit card just yet, though; the <a href=\"https://www.buffalo.jp/contents/product/detail/hd-skl/\">Buffalo Skeleton Hard Disk</a> is limited to just 50 units priced at 100,000 yen each (around $695) and is only available for purchase starting in June via a lottery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Skeleton Hard Disk mounts a 4TB drive inside a machined aluminum housing with a small window attached to a display base weighing about 3.3 pounds. Its gold and anodized black finish is an homage to a retro Melco (Buffalo’s parent company) record player, which was first released in 1978.</p>\n<img alt=\"A close-up of the back of the Buffalo Skeleton Hard Disk showing its connectors.\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/buffalo_skeleton_harddisk_drive3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.775619489401,100,78.448761021198\" title=\"A close-up of the back of the Buffalo Skeleton Hard Disk showing its connectors.\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Try as you might, you’re probably not going to be able to squeeze the HD-SKL into a gaming PC without reaching for an angle grinder. It’s designed to be a display piece, and features a power connector on the back as well as one of those USB 3.2 Micro-B ports that’s wider and flatter than a standard USB-A port.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’d rather not wait for the drive to come to life while moving data to or from it, Buffalo has an accompanying piece of software called SeekWizard (for Windows users only, although the HD-SKL works with both PCs and Macs) that will make its read arm move in various patterns. These include modes simulating regular movements while the drive is accessing data, or making it function like a ticking metronome or a timer. It’s fun, but making the drive perform for you at will may be one of the reasons Buffalo only lists a one-month warranty.</p>\n<img alt=\"A side-by-side comparison of Buffalo’s new Skeleton Hard Disk versus the original from 1998.\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/buffalo_skeleton_harddisk_drive2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" title=\"A side-by-side comparison of Buffalo’s new Skeleton Hard Disk versus the original from 1998.\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Buffalo HD-SKL isn’t the first hard drive to reveal what’s going on inside while it’s operating. It’s actually a follow-up to the 4.3GB Skeleton Hard Disk Buffalo first released in 1998, which had a fully transparent housing that put all of its electronic components on display. At CES 2006, Western Digital <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/worlds-first-transparent-hard-drive-launched/\">launched a 150GB serial ATA drive called the Raptor X</a> with a similar design to the new HD-SKL that used a small window to reveal a portion of its interior.</p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Buffalo put a window on its new hard drive so you can see it at work  \n\nBuffalo has unveiled a limited-edition novelty hard drive with a window that reveals its inner mechanics. The **Buffalo Skeleton Hard Disk** celebrates the 50th anniversary of its parent company, Melco, and features a 4TB drive encased in machined aluminum with a gold and black finish. Only 50 units will be sold via lottery in June, priced at around $695 each. The drive includes a companion Windows app, SeekWizard, which lets users control the read arm’s movement for visual effects—though this may contribute to its short one-month warranty.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis release is less about practicality and more about nostalgia and aesthetic appeal, harkening back to Buffalo’s 1998 transparent hard drive and Western Digital’s 2006 Raptor X. While novelty hard drives like this won’t replace mainstream storage solutions, they highlight how tech companies blend retro design with modern functionality to create collector’s items. The limited availability and high price tag position it as a niche product for enthusiasts rather than everyday users."
