The fake extension then sent the data to a Discord server that Kramer operated. To better disguise the malicious code, it was folded into files that used the names OpenAI and Anthropic.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/man-pleads-guilty-to-using-malicious-ai-software-to-hack-disney-employee/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/man-pleads-guilty-to-using-malicious-ai-software-to-hack-disney-employee/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Man Pleads Guilty to Using Malicious AI Software to Hack Disney Employee  \n\nA California man, Ryan Mitchell Kramer, has pleaded guilty to hacking a Disney employee by distributing a malicious AI image-generation tool. The 25-year-old published a fake GitHub app called ComfyUI_LLMVISION, which appeared to be an extension for the legitimate ComfyUI software. Instead, the program stole sensitive data, including passwords and payment details, and sent it to a Discord server under his control. Kramer operated under the alias NullBulge and disguised the malware using filenames referencing OpenAI and Anthropic.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis case highlights the growing risks of AI-powered cybercrime, where attackers exploit trust in open-source tools to distribute malware. The incident underscores the need for heightened vigilance when downloading third-party AI applications, especially those claiming to enhance popular platforms. As AI adoption grows, so does the potential for malicious actors to weaponize these tools, making cybersecurity awareness critical for businesses and individuals alike."
