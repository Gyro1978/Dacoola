Skype still had users until the bitter end, but both Microsoft and the world had more or less moved on. Microsoft has shifted all its investment to Teams, a corporate-focused app that the company swears will someday catch on with regular people. Zoom and Meet and countless other apps do video chat perfectly well.

        "generated_article_body_md": "## RIP Skype — you were right about almost everything  \n\nMicrosoft officially shut down Skype on May 2025, nearly 14 years after acquiring it for $8.5 billion. The once-revolutionary platform, which FCC chairman Michael Powell in 2003 hailed as the future of communication, ultimately saw its relevance fade as competitors like Zoom, Teams, and WhatsApp took over. Despite its decline, Skype’s early vision of free, high-quality global calls reshaped the telecom industry—only to be left behind by the very trends it pioneered.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nSkype’s shutdown underscores how quickly tech landscapes evolve. It was among the first to prove that internet-based communication could rival traditional telecom, paving the way for today’s dominant apps. Yet, its inability to adapt—while Microsoft shifted focus to Teams—highlights the risks of resting on early success. This Skype retrospective serves as a reminder that even groundbreaking innovations must continuously evolve to stay relevant."
