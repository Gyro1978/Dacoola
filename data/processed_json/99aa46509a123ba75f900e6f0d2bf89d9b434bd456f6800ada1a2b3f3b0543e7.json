        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple Is Moving Away From Its Fall-Only iPhone Launch Schedule, Report Says  \n\nApple is reportedly shifting away from its traditional fall-only iPhone launch schedule, according to a new report. Instead, the company may separate its releases, giving budget-friendly iPhones their own spotlight while reserving a separate launch event for Pro and premium models. This change could mark a significant shift in Apple's long-standing iPhone launch schedule strategy.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nApple's move to split its iPhone launches could help the company better differentiate its product tiers and maintain consumer interest throughout the year. By separating budget and Pro models, Apple may avoid overshadowing its more affordable devices while giving premium models the exclusive attention they demand. This strategy could also help Apple better compete in a crowded smartphone market by keeping its lineup fresh and generating multiple waves of media coverage."
