    "summary": "<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"A pair of Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds against a colorful background.\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Beats-Powerbeats-Pro-2-Deal-Header.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the longest time, we considered the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple\">Beats Fit Pro</a> to be the best gym earbuds around. However, with the arrival of the <strong>Powerbeats Pro 2</strong> in February, Beats’ last-gen earbuds have become somewhat dated and a lot harder to recommend at full price. That’s especially true today, given the Powerbeats Pro 2 are now on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Powerbeats-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds/dp/B0DT2344N3/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Beats-Powerbeats-Pro-2-High-Performance-Earbuds-Jet-Black/15075506141\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1876127-REG/beats_by_dr_dre_mx723ll_a_powerbeats_pro_2_wireless.html\">B&H Photo</a> in multiple colors for an all-time low of $199.95 ($50 off).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Pro 2 are, by all accounts, some of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds#:~:text=The%20best%20earbuds%20for%20sports%20and%20working%20out\">best wireless earbuds</a> you can get. They still tout the signature ear hook design found on previous models, though the hooks themselves are noticeably smaller this time around (as is the wireless charging case). The comfortable earbuds also feature active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode — both absent from the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price\">first-gen model from 2019</a> —so you can stay in sync with what’s going on around you while exercising.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for other hallmarks, the fitness-focused Pro 2 sport IPX4 water resistance, easy-to-use physical buttons, and native support for both Android and Apple features — including head-tracking spatial audio, automatic device switching, and Find My integration for iPhone users. They also offer heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors in each earbud; however, sadly, they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/620706/powerbeats-pro-2-apple-heart-rate-gym-equipment\">can’t play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment</a> at the same time when paired with an iOS device, which makes the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thankfully, if bass-heavy sound is what you’re after and not necessarily the ability to track your heart rate, rest assured that this pair of Beats delivers great sound with enough low-end oomph to make the latest tracks from Kendrick Lamar and Saba shine. They can’t rival the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review\">latest AirPods Pro</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23803374/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review\">Sony’s XM5</a>, but that’s not really the point, is it?</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/headphone-review/609473/powerbeats-pro-2-review-headphones-heart-rate-monitoring-wearables\">Read our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">More ways to save today</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>Google Pixel</strong> <strong>9A</strong>, which is arguably the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap\">best budget phone</a> you can buy right now, is available from <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9a-128gb-unlocked-iris/6612951.p?skuId=6612951\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://store.google.com/config/pixel_9a?hl=en-US\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> for $499 with a free $100 gift card (or store credit, in the case of Google). The terrific midrange handset is outfitted with Google’s reliable Tensor G4 chipset and a 6.3-inch OLED screen, the latter of which is bigger and brighter than the panel on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24162073/google-pixel-8a-review-specs-price-camera\">last year’s 8A</a>. It also packs a robust IP68 rating and seven years of software updates — an impressive feat for a phone that retails for under $500. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/phone-review/646135/google-pixel-9a-review-a-midrange-phone-done-right\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Star Wars Day might technically be behind us, but you can still grab a <strong>Goliath Power Saber</strong> at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZW9KJ2V\">Amazon</a> for $15.28 (about $6 off), which is the best price we’ve seen. The lightsaber-like saber <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24226439/goliath-power-saber-star-wars-lightsaber-hasbro-disney\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">isn’t an official <em>Star Wars </em>toy</a> — blame Hasbro — but it is the first light-up blade that can automatically extend <em>and</em> retract with the push of a button. It will also collapse when you press it against something, meaning you needn’t worry (too much) about giving it to a kid.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re looking for a cheap charger to take on the go, <strong>Anker’s 10,000mAh Zolo Power Bank</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-Charging-Battery/dp/B0CZ9M6X8Q/?th=1\">Amazon</a> in a slew of colors for $12.94 ($13 off), matching its best price to date. The 30W battery pack isn’t the most robust in terms of capacity, though it can deliver up to two full charges to an iPhone 16 Pro; it also features an integrated 5.4-inch USB-C cable for added convenience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## The sporty Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 are on sale for $50 off for the first time  \n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, known for their fitness-friendly design and active noise cancellation, are now available at an all-time low price of $199.95 ($50 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and B&H Photo. These wireless earbuds feature improved ear hooks, IPX4 water resistance, and heart rate monitoring (though limited for iOS users). While they don’t match the AirPods Pro or Sony XM5 in sound quality, they deliver strong bass and solid performance for workouts.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis discount marks the first significant price drop for the Powerbeats Pro 2 since their February release, making them a more compelling choice for fitness enthusiasts. The inclusion of ANC and transparency mode—absent in the first-gen model—enhances their appeal, though the heart rate monitoring limitation for iPhone users is a notable drawback. For Android users or those prioritizing durability and gym-friendly features over audiophile-grade sound, this Beats earbuds sale presents a solid opportunity to upgrade."
