        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple Legal Battle Intensifies as Company Fights Judge's Contempt Order  \n\nApple is pushing back against a US district judge's ruling that found the company in contempt for allegedly violating a 2021 order related to its App Store policies. The tech giant has asked an appeals court to pause the decision, arguing it unlawfully restricts Apple's control over its business operations. The case stems from an antitrust lawsuit filed by Epic Games, creator of Fortnite, which accused Apple of anti-competitive practices.  \n\nJudge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled last week that Apple deliberately ignored her earlier injunction requiring the company to allow alternative payment options in the App Store. Apple's legal team called the contempt finding \"extraordinary,\" claiming it forces the company to \"give away free access to its products and services.\"  \n\n### Key Developments in the Apple Legal Battle  \n\nThe dispute dates back to 2020 when Epic Games sued Apple, alleging the App Store's 15-30% commission fees constituted an illegal monopoly. While the judge rejected the monopoly claim, she ruled Apple violated California competition laws by blocking developers from directing users to cheaper payment methods outside the App Store.  \n\nLast week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers accused Apple of continuing to interfere with competition, citing internal documents that showed executives, including CEO Tim Cook, knowingly disregarded her injunction. She stated Cook \"chose poorly\" by ignoring recommendations to comply. Apple has denied wrongdoing and says it will follow the order while appealing.  \n\n#### Financial and Strategic Implications  \n\nApple argues the restrictions could cost it \"substantial sums annually\" by preventing fees on external purchases. The company maintains the original injunction was invalid and claims the contempt order unfairly punishes it for conduct not deemed unlawful. Legal experts suggest this case could reshape how Apple and other tech giants operate their app marketplaces.  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n\n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">What triggered Apple's legal battle with Epic Games? <i class=\"faq-icon fas fa-chevron-down\"></i></summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Epic Games sued Apple in 2020, alleging the App Store's fees and restrictions violated antitrust laws by stifling competition.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Why did the judge hold Apple in contempt? <i class=\"faq-icon fas fa-chevron-down\"></i></summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Judge Gonzalez Rogers found Apple deliberately ignored her 2021 order to allow alternative payment options, citing internal documents showing executives knowingly avoided compliance.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">What happens next in the Apple legal battle? <i class=\"faq-icon fas fa-chevron-down\"></i></summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Apple is appealing the contempt ruling, seeking to pause enforcement while the case proceeds.
