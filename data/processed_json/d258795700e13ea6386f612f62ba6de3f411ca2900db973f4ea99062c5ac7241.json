        "generated_article_body_md": "## Dozens of YouTube Channels Are Showing AI-Generated Cartoon Gore and Fetish Content  \n\nA WIRED investigation uncovered dozens of YouTube channels using generative AI to create disturbing videos featuring cartoon characters like cats and minions being subjected to violence, starvation, and sexualization. The findings have sparked fears of a resurgence of \"Elsagate\"-style content, where inappropriate videos slip past moderation to target young viewers.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThe rise of AI-generated harmful content presents a new challenge for platforms like YouTube, which have long struggled with moderation. Unlike traditional user-uploaded videos, AI-generated content can be mass-produced, making it harder to detect and remove. This trend also highlights the ethical risks of generative AI, as bad actors exploit the technology to bypass safeguards. If left unchecked, such content could normalize harmful behaviors for vulnerable audiences, particularly children who may stumble upon these videos."
