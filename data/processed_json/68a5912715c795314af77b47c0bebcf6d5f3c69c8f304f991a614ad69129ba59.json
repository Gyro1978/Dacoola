He noted that Epic created its Sweden account last year so it could launch the Epic Games Store and <em>Fortnite</em> in the EU.

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Epic will use an EU account to bring Fortnite back to the US App Store  \n\nEpic Games plans to submit *Fortnite* to Apple’s US iOS App Store using its Sweden-based developer account, according to CEO Tim Sweeney. This follows a recent court ruling that blocked Apple from collecting fees on external purchases, prompting Epic to announce *Fortnite’s* return \"next week.\" Apple had terminated Epic’s US developer account in 2020 after the company introduced an alternative payment system, sparking a lengthy legal battle. Sweeney confirmed Epic will use its EU-domiciled account, originally created to comply with EU regulations, to facilitate the game’s US return.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis move highlights the ongoing tension between Apple and Epic Games over App Store policies and fees. By leveraging its EU account, Epic circumvents Apple’s US ban while testing the boundaries of the recent court ruling. The return of *Fortnite* could signal a shift in how developers challenge Apple’s control, especially as regulatory scrutiny intensifies globally. However, with Apple appealing the decision, the battle is far from over—making this a critical moment for app store ecosystems."
