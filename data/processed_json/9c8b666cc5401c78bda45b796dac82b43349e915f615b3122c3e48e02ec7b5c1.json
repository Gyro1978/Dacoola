The company attributes this potential decline to regulatory pressures, highlighting the Meta EU regulation impact on its operations.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis warning underscores the growing tension between tech giants and EU regulators, who have been tightening data privacy and competition rules. If Meta follows through, European users may see reduced functionality or slower service, setting a precedent for how global platforms adapt to stricter regional laws. The move could also signal broader challenges for other tech firms navigating compliance while maintaining user satisfaction."
