The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often some amount to be saved, particularly on Apple’s more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Mini are also regularly discounted, as is the latest iPad Air.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"> </h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#CM2y8j\">The best iPad (2022) deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#the-best-ipad-2025-deals\">The best iPad (2025) deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#njqbEo\">The best iPad Mini (2024) deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#the-best-ipad-air-2024-deals\">The best iPad Air (2025) deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml#iuddo9\">The best iPad Pro (2024) deals</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>It’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at <em>The Verge </em>are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CM2y8j\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\">iPad (2022)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\"><strong>10th-gen iPad</strong></a> came out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">Apple’s latest entry-level model</a>, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1924288816\">Walmart</a> starting at $299 ($50 off), which is $40 more than its best price to date. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLBNNRT/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1497747190\">Walmart</a> are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for just shy of $350 ($150 off), which is a better deal when you consider you can currently grab an 11th-gen iPad with an expanded 128GB of storage at Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/\">starting at $299</a> ($100 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-2025-deals\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review\">iPad (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As noted above, <strong>Apple’s 11th-gen iPad</strong> just recently landed on the scene. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">new base-model tablet</a> is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We haven’t seen significant price drops yet, though the entry-level model is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ751XN6/?th=1\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver/15483805722\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-a16-10-9-inch-wi-fi-128gb-2025-11th-generation-blue/-/A-85966318\">Target</a> starting at around $299 ($50 off) right now. Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ773FRV/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver/15419323073\">Walmart</a> starting at $399 ($50 off), or the 512GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ75HDQ4/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue/15462502488\">Walmart</a> starting at $599 ($50 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"njqbEo\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review\">iPad Mini (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>The new <strong>seventh-gen iPad Mini</strong> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\">the outgoing model</a> but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-ipad-mini-a17-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578253.p?skuId=6578253\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-128gb-2024-space-gray/-/A-85966283\">Target</a> for around $399 ($100 off), matching its lowest price to date. You can also pick up the 256GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XM94S/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/13267767957\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-128gb-2024-space-gray/-/A-85966283?preselect=85966258\">Target</a> for $499 ($100 off), or the 512GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XT3DX/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-ipad-mini-a17-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-512gb-space-gray/6578262.p?skuId=6578262\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-mini-a17-pro-wi-fi-2024/-/A-94152198?preselect=91122046\">Target</a> for $699 ($100 off). That’s the best price we’ve seen on both of the step-up configurations.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-air-2024-deals\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025\">best iPad Air (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>2025 iPad Air</strong> is little more than a spec bump over the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024\">previous model</a>, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-11-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578280.p?skuId=6578280\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-air-m3-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/-/A-91122029/\">Target</a> in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at around $499 ($50 off). Amazon also has the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76RM7P/\">256GB model for around $599</a> ($100 off) and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ7466KC/\">512GB model for around $799</a> ($100 off), as does <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-11-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578280.p?skuId=6578280\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-air-m3-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/-/A-91122029?preselect=85966355\">Target</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-13-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76QBLQ/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-13-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578297.p?skuId=6578297\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-air-m3-13-inch-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/-/A-91122010\">Target</a> with 128GB of storage starting at around $699 ($100 off). You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-13-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ75MMRH/\">Amazon</a> starting at $776.50 (about $123 off), or the 512GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-13-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ75PK41/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-13-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-512gb-blue/6578306.p?skuId=6578306\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-air-m3-13-inch-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/-/A-91122010?preselect=91122080\">Target</a> starting at around $999 ($100 off), which remains its lowest price to date.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"iuddo9\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review\">iPad Pro (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review\"><strong>2024 iPad Pro</strong></a> is a far more impressive upgrade than the latest iPad Air. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24148451/apple-m4-chip-ai-ipad-macbook\">M4 chip</a>, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.</p>\n\n<p>As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-11-inch-ipad-pro-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-256gb-with-oled-space-black/5495362.p?skuId=5495362\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-pro-11-inch-m4-2024-5th-generation-wifi-256gb-with-standard-glass-space-black/-/A-85966229/\">Target</a> starting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9SMLK/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-256gb-with-oled-space-black/6533540.p?skuId=6533540\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-pro-13-inch-m4-2024-7th-generation-wifi-256gb-with-standard-glass-space-black/-/A-85966373\">Target</a> starting at $1,099 ($200 off), which matches the lowest price we’ve seen.</p>",

The latest iPad Mini is down to $399 ($100 off), matching its lowest price to date. Meanwhile, the 10th-gen iPad (2022) starts at $299 ($50 off), and the new 11th-gen iPad (2025) is available for as low as $299 ($100 off). Higher-end models like the iPad Air and iPad Pro also see discounts, with the 13-inch iPad Pro dropping to $1,099 ($200 off).  \n\n### Why It Matters  \niPad deals outside of Black Friday or Prime Day are rare, making these discounts noteworthy for anyone looking to upgrade or purchase a new tablet. The price cuts on newer models, such as the M4-powered iPad Pro and the A17 Pro-equipped iPad Mini, suggest retailers are pushing inventory ahead of potential new releases. For budget-conscious buyers, the entry-level iPad remains a solid choice, while power users can take advantage of steep discounts on premium models."
