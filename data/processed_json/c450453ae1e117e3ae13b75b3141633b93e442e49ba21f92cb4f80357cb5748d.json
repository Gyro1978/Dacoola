        "generated_article_body_md": "## Tesla Leadership Rumors: Board Denies CEO Replacement Search  \n\nTesla has firmly denied reports suggesting the company contacted headhunters to find a replacement for CEO Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journal claimed Tesla’s board sought a successor due to concerns over Musk’s divided focus between Tesla and his role in the Trump administration, as well as the company's declining stock performance. However, Tesla’s board, including Chair Robyn Denholm, dismissed the report as \"absolutely false,\" reaffirming confidence in Musk’s leadership.  \n\nMusk himself criticized the WSJ’s reporting on X, calling it an \"extremely bad breach of ethics.\" Meanwhile, Tesla faces backlash from customers and investors over Musk’s political affiliations and the company’s financial struggles.  \n\n### Unpacking the Controversy  \n\nThe Wall Street Journal’s report alleged that Tesla’s board had grown frustrated with Musk’s divided attention, particularly his involvement in Trump’s newly formed Department for Government Efficiency (Doge). The board reportedly urged Musk to publicly commit more time to Tesla, which he did during a recent earnings call. However, Tesla’s swift denial suggests internal confidence in Musk’s ability to balance his roles.  \n\nMusk’s dual leadership has sparked criticism, with some Tesla customers boycotting the brand over his political stance. Protests and vandalism at dealerships have further complicated Tesla’s public image. Investors, meanwhile, cite Musk’s reputation and overextension as factors in Tesla’s financial challenges.  \n\n#### Public and Market Reactions  \n\nTesla’s stock has been volatile amid these leadership rumors, reflecting investor uncertainty. Musk’s pledge to reduce his government role temporarily eased concerns, but questions linger about his long-term commitment. Trump’s vocal support for Musk—including a pledge to buy a Tesla—adds another layer of political complexity.  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n\n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Did Tesla’s board really search for a new CEO?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>No. Tesla’s board and Chair Robyn Denholm explicitly denied the WSJ’s report, calling it \"absolutely false.\"</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Why is Elon Musk facing criticism?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Musk’s involvement in Trump’s administration and Tesla’s financial struggles have drawn backlash from customers and investors.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n</div>"
