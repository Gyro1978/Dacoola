        "generated_article_body_md": "## Beware phony IT calls after Co-op and M&S hacks, says UK cyber centre  \n\nThe UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has urged businesses to review their IT help desk \"password reset processes\" following recent cyberattacks targeting major retailers like Co-op and Marks & Spencer (M&S). The agency highlights a rise in fraudulent IT support calls attempting to exploit weak verification protocols, posing a significant cybersecurity warning for organizations.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis advisory underscores a growing tactic among hackers: impersonating IT personnel to bypass security measures. Retailers, often handling sensitive customer data, are prime targets. The NCSC's alert signals the need for stricter authentication procedures, especially in help desk operations, to prevent unauthorized access. Businesses across sectors should take noteâ€”attackers frequently shift focus after high-profile breaches, making proactive verification essential."
