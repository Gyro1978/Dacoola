        "generated_article_body_md": "## Data centers say Trump’s crackdown on renewables bad for business, AI  \n\nThe US data center industry warns that former President Donald Trump’s restrictions on renewable energy could slow its expansion and jeopardize America’s competitiveness in AI. His administration has suspended clean energy projects on federal land, paused loans, and canceled major initiatives like Equinor’s $5 billion Empire Wind project. Experts say this could create power shortages, raise costs, and force data centers to rely on dirtier energy sources.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nData centers and AI development require massive energy, and renewables offer a sustainable solution. Trump’s energy policy risks creating bottlenecks that could delay AI advancements, increase operational costs, and push the industry toward less eco-friendly alternatives. This could undermine both economic growth and climate goals, making it harder for the US to maintain its lead in AI innovation."
