Microsoft is OK with that.  \n\nMicrosoft has acknowledged that its Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) allows users to log in with revoked passwords, a counterintuitive security behavior that contradicts standard password reset practices. The company states this is an intentional design decision rather than a bug, prioritizing user accessibility over immediate security updates. This Windows RDP security quirk means that even after changing a compromised password, attackers could still access systems via RDP in certain scenarios.  \n\nThe Remote Desktop Protocol, Microsoft’s proprietary tool for remote system access, continues to trust old credentials in many cases, bypassing typical password revocation measures. According to Microsoft, this ensures users don’t get locked out of their systems unintentionally. However, this approach raises concerns, as password changes are a critical first response to breaches—users expect revoked credentials to be fully invalidated.  \n\n### Not just a bug  \nMicrosoft’s stance suggests the behavior is deeply embedded in RDP’s functionality rather than an oversight. While the company has no immediate plans to alter this design, the revelation highlights potential risks for organizations relying on RDP for remote access. Security experts may need to implement additional safeguards, such as multi-factor authentication, to mitigate the issue."
