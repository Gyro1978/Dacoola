This change follows a recent ruling that barred Apple from charging a 27% commission on in-app purchases. Amazon stated that the update is part of its ongoing efforts to improve customer convenience.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nThis move highlights the broader impact of regulatory decisions on app ecosystems. By bypassing Apple’s fees, Amazon can offer a smoother purchasing experience while potentially lowering costs for consumers. It also signals a shift in how major platforms may adapt to antitrust rulings, reshaping digital marketplaces."
