But the technology consumes quite a bit of power. In a data center containing 400,000 GPUs, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/silicon-photonics/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a> estimates that optical transceivers burn <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_blank\">40 megawatts</a>. Right now, the only way to deal with all that heat is to hope you can thermally connect<strong> </strong>these transceivers to the switch system’s case and cool that. It’s not a great solution, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ttarter/\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Tarter</a>, principal thermal engineer at startup <a href=\"https://xmems.com/\" target=\"_blank\">xMEMS Labs</a>, but because these transceivers are about the size of an overlarge USB stick, there’s no way to stick a conventional cooling fan in each.</p><p>Now, xMEMS says it has adapted its upcoming ultrasonic microelectromechanical (MEMS) “fan-on-a-chip” to fit inside a pluggable optical transceiver so it drives air through and cools the transceiver’s main digital part, the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/chip-hall-of-fame-texas-instruments-tms32010-digital-signal-processor\" target=\"_blank\">digital signal processor</a> (DSP). Keeping the DSP cool is critical to its longevity, says Tarter. At upwards of US $2,000 per transceiver, getting an extra year or two from a transceiver is well worth it. Cooling should also improve the integrity of the transceivers’ signals. Unreliable links are blamed for extending already lengthy training runs for new large language models.</p><h2>xMEMS’ Cooling Tech Finds a New Home</h2><p>The xMEMS chip-cooling tech, which was <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/xmems\" target=\"_self\"><u>unveiled in August 2024</u></a>, builds on the company’s earlier product, solid-state <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mems-speakers-xmems\" target=\"_blank\">microspeakers for earbuds</a>. It uses piezoelectric materials that can change shape at ultrasound frequencies to pump 39 cubic centimeters of air per second through a chip just about a millimeter high and less than a centimeter on a side.</p><p>Smartphones, which are <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/superslim-liquid-loop-will-keep-future-smartphones-cool\" target=\"_blank\">too slim to carry a fan</a>, were the first obvious application for the MEMS<strong> </strong>cooler, but cooling the fast-growing data-center-scale AI systems seemed out of reach for MEMS technology, because it can’t come near to matching the liquid <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/immersion-cooling\" target=\"_blank\">cooling systems</a> removing thousands of watts of heat from GPU servers. </p><p>“We were pleasantly surprised by the approach by data-center customers,” says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-housholder-3a25103/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Housholder</a>, xMEMS vice president of marketing. “We were focused on low power. So we didn’t think we had a slam dunk.”</p><p>Pluggable optical transceivers turn out to be a data-center technology that is squarely in the fan-on-a-chip’s wheelhouse. Today, heat from a transceiver’s DSP, photonics IC, and lasers is thermally coupled to the network switch computers they are plugged into. (These usually sit at the top of a rack of computers.) Then air moving over fins built into the switch’s face removes the heat. </p><p>In collaboration with partners they would not name, xMEMS began exploring how to get air flowing through the transceiver. These parts consume 18 watts or more. But by situating the company’s MEMS chip within an airflow channel that is thermally connected to the transceiver chips but physically isolated from them, the company predicts it will be able to drop the DSP’s temperature by more than 15 percent.</p><p>xMEMS has been making prototype MEMS chips at Stanford’s nanofabrication facility, but it will have its first production silicon from TSMC in June, says Housholder. The company expects to be in full production in the first quarter of 2026. “That aligns well with our early customers,” he says.</p><p>Transceiver shipments are growing fast, according to the <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/large-scale-ai-clusters-to-fuel-more-growth-in-coherent-optical-transceiver-shipments-according-to-delloro-group-302295840.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dell’Oro Group</a>. The market analyst predicts that shipments of 800-gigabit-per-second and 1.6-terabit-per-second parts will grow at more than 35 percent per year through 2028. Other innovations in optical communications that could affect heat and power are also in the offing. In March, <a href=\"https://www.broadcom.com/company/news/product-releases/62986\" target=\"_blank\">Broadcom unveiled a new DSP</a> that could lead to a more than 20 percent power reduction for 1.6 Tb/s transceivers, due in part to the use of a more advanced chip-manufacturing process. The latter company and Nvidia have separately developed <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co-packaged-optics\" target=\"_blank\">network switches that do away with pluggable transceivers</a> altogether. These new “co-packaged optics” do the optical/electronic conversion on silicon within the switch chip’s package. </p><p>But Tarter, who has been working on cooling chips since the 1980s, predicts there will be more applications both inside and outside the data center for the MEMS chip to come. “We’re learning a lot about applications,” he says. “I’ve come up with 20 or 30 basic applications for it, and hopefully that inspires designers to say ‘Oh, this is how I can use this in my system.’”</p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Tiny “Fans-on-Chips” Could Cool Big Data Centers  \n\nStartup xMEMS Labs has adapted its ultrasonic microelectromechanical (MEMS) \"fan-on-a-chip\" technology to cool pluggable optical transceivers in data centers, addressing a critical bottleneck in **data center cooling**. These transceivers, essential for AI workloads, consume 40 megawatts in large GPU clusters, with heat dissipation currently relying on inefficient thermal coupling to switch systems. The MEMS solution, originally designed for smartphones, pumps air through the transceiver’s digital signal processor (DSP), potentially lowering temperatures by 15% and extending the lifespan of the $2,000+ components. xMEMS expects full production by early 2026, aligning with surging demand for high-speed transceivers.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nData centers face escalating thermal challenges as AI workloads push hardware limits. xMEMS’ innovation could reduce energy waste and improve signal reliability in optical links, which are notorious for disrupting AI training runs. While liquid cooling dominates GPU cooling, MEMS fans offer a scalable, low-power alternative for transceivers—a niche where traditional fans are impractical. This development highlights how micro-scale engineering can solve macro-scale problems, potentially unlocking further applications in electronics cooling. As transceiver shipments grow 35% annually, efficient thermal management becomes a competitive edge for AI infrastructure."
