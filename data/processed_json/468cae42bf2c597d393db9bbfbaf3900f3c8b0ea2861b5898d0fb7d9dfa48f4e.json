        "generated_article_body_md": "## Driverless Semis Have Started Running Regular Longhaul Routes  \n\nDriverless semis have reached a significant milestone by beginning regular longhaul routes, signaling a major step forward in autonomous freight transportation. This development highlights the growing adoption of self-driving technology in the logistics industry, where efficiency and safety are paramount. The deployment of these vehicles on standard routes suggests that the technology has advanced enough to handle real-world conditions without human intervention.  \n\nThe shift to autonomous semis could transform the trucking industry by reducing labor costs and improving delivery consistency. While the exact routes and companies involved were not detailed, the move indicates confidence in the reliability of driverless systems for extended hauls. Regulatory approvals and technological refinements have likely played a key role in enabling this transition.  \n\n### Significance  \nThe introduction of driverless semis on regular longhaul routes could pave the way for broader adoption, potentially reshaping supply chains and freight logistics. If successful, this could lead to increased efficiency and reduced transportation costs across industries."
