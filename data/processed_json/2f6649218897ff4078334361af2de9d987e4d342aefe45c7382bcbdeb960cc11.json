Unable to keep up with rivals like Zoom and FaceTime, the iconic service will be discontinued, marking the end of an era in digital communication.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nSkype’s shutdown highlights the rapid evolution of communication tools and the challenges legacy platforms face in staying relevant. Microsoft’s decision to fold Skype into Teams reflects a broader industry shift toward unified collaboration platforms. For users, this transition signals the need to adapt to newer, more competitive alternatives—underscoring how quickly tech landscapes can change."
