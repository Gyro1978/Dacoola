AI in bug hunting is automating parts of the process, making it faster and more efficient, while also altering how security researchers operate.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nThe integration of AI into bug hunting signals a major shift in cybersecurity. While AI can accelerate vulnerability detection, it may also reduce the need for manual testing, impacting traditional bug hunters. This evolution highlights the growing role of automation in security, raising questions about the future balance between human expertise and AI-driven solutions."
