        "generated_article_body_md": "## Google is making TV and movies to convince you that tech is not evil  \n\nGoogle is reportedly launching a film and TV production initiative called *100 Zeroes*, aimed at fostering a more positive view of its products and the tech industry among younger audiences. According to *Business Insider*, the project mirrors Apple’s approach, where its devices are prominently featured in shows. This move suggests Google is doubling down on **Google PR films** to counter growing skepticism around Big Tech.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nTech giants are increasingly investing in media to shape public perception, as regulatory scrutiny and privacy concerns erode trust. Google’s *100 Zeroes* signals a shift from traditional advertising to narrative-driven storytelling—a tactic Apple has successfully used to reinforce brand loyalty. However, critics may see this as an attempt to gloss over deeper ethical issues rather than addressing them directly. The success of such campaigns could redefine how tech companies engage with audiences beyond product placements."
