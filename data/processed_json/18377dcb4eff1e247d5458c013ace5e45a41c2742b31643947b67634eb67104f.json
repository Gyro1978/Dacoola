Here's Visa's vision of automated shopping  \n\nVisa has unveiled a vision for AI-enhanced credit cards that could automate shopping by using AI agents to find and order products on behalf of users.

If successful, AI-enhanced credit cards could redefine convenience in e-commerce, potentially reducing decision fatigue and saving time for users. However, questions around security, privacy, and user control will need addressing before widespread adoption."
