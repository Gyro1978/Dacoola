        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple and Meta Attack 'Unfair' €700m EU Fines  \nApple and Meta have strongly criticized the European Union, accusing regulators of unfairly targeting US tech companies with hefty fines totaling €700 million. The firms argue that the penalties are unjust and reflect bias against American corporations.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nThis dispute highlights growing tensions between Big Tech and EU regulators, who have been tightening oversight of digital markets. The fines could set a precedent for future enforcement actions, signaling stricter compliance demands for global tech firms operating in Europe. If upheld, these penalties may push companies to reconsider their regulatory strategies in the region."
