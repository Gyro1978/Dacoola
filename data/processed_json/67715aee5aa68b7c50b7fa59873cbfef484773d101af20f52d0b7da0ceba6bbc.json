        "generated_article_body_md": "## Microsoft’s new “passwordless by default” is great but comes at a cost  \n\nMicrosoft is taking a major step toward eliminating passwords by making **passwordless authentication** the default option for new user accounts. The company announced this initiative as part of an industry-wide effort to move away from traditional passwords, which have long been a weak point in cybersecurity. By prioritizing passkeys—a more secure alternative—Microsoft aims to reduce the risks of phishing and credential theft.  \n\nA key component of this shift is the adoption of passkeys, a technology developed in collaboration with Google, Apple, and the FIDO Alliance. Passkeys provide a more secure and user-friendly login method, eliminating the need for memorizing complex passwords. Microsoft will now prompt existing users to set up a passkey upon their next login, while new users will automatically default to this method.  \n\nThis move aligns with broader industry trends toward stronger authentication standards. While the transition may require adjustments for some users, the long-term benefits—such as reduced security breaches and simplified logins—could outweigh the initial challenges."
