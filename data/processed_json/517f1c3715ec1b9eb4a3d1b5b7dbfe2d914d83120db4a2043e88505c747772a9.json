Honing robots’ tactile abilities further may allow them to take on more fulfillment and manufacturing work in the years ahead.\nAaron Parness, Amazon’s director of robotics AI who led the development of Vulcan, explains that touch sensing helps the robot push items around on a shelf and identify what it’s after. “When you’re trying to stow [or pick] items in one of these pods, you can't really do that task without making contact with the other items,” he says.\nThe Vulcan system consists of a conventional robotic arm with a custom spatula-like appendage for poking into a shelf, and a sucker for grabbing items to pull them out.\nVulcan has sensors on several of its joints that allow the robot to detect the edge and contours of items.

The company says the robot is already working at this facility and another in Spokane, Washington.\nThe new robots will work on the same line as human pickers, and will aim to spare them from back-aching work by grasping more items from shelves that are high up or low down. Items that the robot decides it cannot find will be reassigned to human workers.\n“Amazon stores many different products in bins, so rummaging is necessary to pull out a specific object to fill an order,” says Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at the University of California, Berkeley. “Until now this has been very difficult, so I'm curious to see the new system.”\nGoldberg says that research on robotic touch sensing has advanced in recent years, with numerous groups working on joint and surface sensing. But he added that robots have some way to go before they can match the tactile abilities of flesh-and-blood workers. “The human sense of touch is extremely sensitive and complex, with a huge dynamic range,” Goldberg says. “Robots are progressing rapidly but I'd be surprised to see human-equivalent [skin] sensors in the next five-to-ten years.”\nRobot coworkers\nEven so, Vulcan should help automate more of the work currently done by humans inside Amazon’s vast empire of fulfillment centers. The company has ramped up automation in recent years with AI-infused robots capable of grabbing and transporting packages and packed boxes. Stowing and retrieving items from shelves is one of the more challenging jobs for robots to do, and it is heavily dependent on human labor.\nParness says he does not foresee robots taking on all of the work done inside Amazon’s fulfillment centers. “We don't really believe in 100 percent automation, or lights out fulfillment,” he says. “We can get to 75 percent and have robots working alongside our employees, and the sum would be greater [than either working alone].”\nIncreased use of robots may raise concerns around automation eliminating human jobs. Some economic studies show that robots can eliminate jobs, while others point to a more complex picture, with automation both replacing workers and creating new roles as productivity increases. Amazon’s robot rollout has seen some new jobs created including ones that involve assisting robots when they get confused or stuck.\nParness says that Amazon plans to give other robots similar sensing capabilities to Vulcan, which should improve their abilities. The company may be cooking up new AI algorithms that make its robots smarter, too, having acquired the team behind a startup called Covariant that was developing AI foundation models for industrial machines. As WIRED revealed last year, other startups such as Physical Intelligence are looking to build AI models that make robots much smarter. Adding touch-sensor data to the training mix could perhaps help speed things up.\nBringing more manufacturing back to US shores, including the iPhone assembly work that Trump seems so keen on would surely require greater use of robots—especially systems with the touchy-feely skills needed to manipulate small, intricate components.\nWhat do you think about Amazon giving robots the power to feel?

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Amazon’s Vulcan: The AI-Powered Tactile Robot Transforming Warehouses  \n\nAmazon has unveiled **Vulcan**, a groundbreaking warehouse robot equipped with **tactile sensing** to navigate shelves and retrieve items with unprecedented precision. This **Amazon tactile robot** represents a leap forward in automation, combining force-torque sensors and AI-driven algorithms to mimic human dexterity. Vulcan’s spatula-like appendage and suction gripper allow it to rummage through bins, reducing reliance on human workers for repetitive tasks. Currently operational in Hamburg and Spokane, Vulcan aims to optimize fulfillment while collaborating with human employees.  \n\n### How Vulcan’s Tactile Technology Works  \n\nVulcan’s **touch-sensing capabilities** rely on force-torque sensors embedded in its joints, enabling it to detect edges and contours of objects. Aaron Parness, Amazon’s director of robotics AI, highlights the role of **machine learning** in interpreting sensor data and refining motion plans. \"The software’s ability to process force feedback is our 'special sauce,'\" Parness explains. This innovation addresses a critical challenge in warehouse automation: manipulating diverse items without visual clarity.  \n\n#### The Human-Robot Collaboration Model  \nAmazon emphasizes a **hybrid workforce**, where Vulcan handles high- or low-reaching tasks while humans manage complex exceptions. Ken Goldberg, a UC Berkeley roboticist, notes that while robots are advancing, they still lag behind human touch sensitivity. \"The dynamic range of human tactile feedback is immense,\" he says. However, Vulcan’s deployment signals progress toward more nuanced automation.  \n\n#### Pros & Cons  \n<div class=\"pros-cons-container\">  \n  <div class=\"pros-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Pros</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      - **Efficiency Boost:** Reduces time spent on repetitive picking tasks.  \n      - **Ergonomic Relief:** Minimizes strain for human workers by handling extreme shelf positions.  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n  <div class=\"cons-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Cons</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      - **Technical Limits:** Cannot yet match human tactile precision for delicate items.  \n      - **Job Displacement Concerns:** Raises questions about long-term roles for warehouse staff.  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n</div>  \n\n### The Future of Tactile Robotics  \nAmazon plans to extend Vulcan’s **sensor technology** to other robots, potentially integrating AI models from Covariant, a recent acquisition. With startups like Physical Intelligence also advancing **AI-driven robotics**, tactile data could accelerate breakthroughs in manufacturing and electronics assembly.  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">How does Vulcan differ from traditional warehouse robots?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Vulcan uses **force-torque sensors** and AI to physically interact with items, unlike vision-only systems that struggle with cluttered bins.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Will Vulcan replace human workers?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Amazon envisions a **75% automation rate**, with robots handling repetitive tasks while humans focus on problem-solving and oversight.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n</div>"
