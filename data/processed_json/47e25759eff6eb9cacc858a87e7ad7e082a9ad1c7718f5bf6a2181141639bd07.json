The retailer is also issuing refunds to customers impacted by the disruption.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis incident highlights the growing vulnerability of major retailers to cyber threats, which can disrupt operations and erode consumer trust. With online sales being a critical revenue stream, prolonged downtime could significantly impact M&Sâ€™s financial performance. The move to issue refunds suggests the attack may have compromised transaction systems, raising concerns about data security. As cyber attacks become more frequent, businesses must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard operations and customer data."
