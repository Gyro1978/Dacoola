        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple referred for possible criminal contempt investigation  \n\nApple is under scrutiny for a potential criminal contempt investigation after allegedly failing to comply with a 2021 court order requiring greater competition in the App Store. The ruling had mandated that Apple open its platform to outside payment options, but regulators now suggest the company may not have fully adhered to the directive.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis development highlights the escalating legal pressure on Apple over its App Store policies, which have long been criticized for stifling competition. If found in contempt, Apple could face significant fines or stricter enforcement, setting a precedent for how tech giants must comply with antitrust rulings. The case underscores the broader regulatory push to dismantle walled ecosystems in favor of consumer choice and developer fairness."
