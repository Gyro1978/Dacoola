        "generated_article_body_md": "## A stealth AI model beat DALL-E and Midjourney on a popular benchmark. Its creator just landed $30M.  \n\nRecraft, a San Francisco-based startup, has raised a $30 million Series B round led by Accel after its AI model outperformed OpenAI’s DALL-E and Midjourney in a respected industry benchmark last year. The funding round also included investments from Khosla Ventures and Madrona. This follows Recraft’s earlier $12 million raise, signaling strong investor confidence in its AI model benchmark performance.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nRecraft’s success highlights the growing competition in generative AI, where smaller players can challenge industry giants like OpenAI. The $30M funding injection suggests investors see potential in specialized AI models that outperform established ones in key benchmarks. This could accelerate innovation in AI-generated imagery, pushing incumbents to improve their offerings while opening doors for niche-focused startups."
