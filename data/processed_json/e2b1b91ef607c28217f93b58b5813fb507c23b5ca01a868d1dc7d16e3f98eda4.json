Despite promises of improved safety, campaigners argue these measures remain insufficient in shielding minors from inappropriate content.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nChild safety on social media remains a critical issue, with platforms like Instagram under increasing scrutiny. The persistence of harmful content suggests gaps in enforcement and algorithmic moderation, raising concerns about long-term impacts on young users' mental health. This highlights the ongoing tension between platform self-regulation and the need for stricter oversight to protect vulnerable audiences."
