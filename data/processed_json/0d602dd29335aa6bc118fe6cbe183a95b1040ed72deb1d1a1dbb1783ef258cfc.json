Users can enter their preferences using natural phrases like “I want something funny and upbeat” or even more detailed requests, such as “I want something scary, but not too scary, and maybe a little bit funny, but not haha funny.”\nThe feature is set to roll out this week to iOS users as an opt-in beta. Some subscribers in Australia and New Zealand have already had access to it, as reported by Bloomberg last month.\nOther streaming competitors are also leveraging generative AI for search. For instance, Amazon has an AI voice search experience on Fire TVs that responds to open-ended inquiries about TV shows and movies. A closer comparison is Tubi’s ChatGPT-powered search tool, which answered content-related questions and suggested movies based on a user’s specific request.\nHowever, Tubi later discontinued the feature, probably because of low adoption. It remains to be seen whether Netflix’s new feature will face similar challenges.\nAdditionally, at the tech and product event, the company mentioned plans to use generative AI to update title cards in subscribers’ preferred languages.\nOther features revealed on Wednesday include a short-form video feed for mobile users and a redesign of its TV homepage.",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Netflix Introduces AI-Powered Search Tool for Smarter Content Discovery  \n\nNetflix has officially unveiled its new **AI-powered search tool**, leveraging OpenAI’s ChatGPT to transform how users discover content. Announced at its recent tech and product event, the feature allows subscribers to search using natural language queries like *“I want something funny and upbeat”* or *“scary but not too scary.”* The tool is rolling out this week as an opt-in beta for iOS users, with initial testing already underway in Australia and New Zealand.  \n\nThis move places Netflix alongside competitors like Amazon and Tubi, which have experimented with AI-driven search. However, Tubi discontinued its similar feature due to low adoption—raising questions about Netflix’s long-term strategy. Beyond search, Netflix also revealed plans to use generative AI for localized title cards and introduced a short-form video feed for mobile users.  \n\n### How Netflix’s AI-Powered Search Works  \n\nThe new tool integrates ChatGPT to interpret conversational queries, offering tailored recommendations based on mood, genre, or even nuanced preferences. Unlike traditional keyword-based searches, this approach mimics human dialogue, making content discovery more intuitive. For example, a request like *“a thriller with a strong female lead”* would generate curated results.  \n\nEarly tests suggest the feature excels at handling vague or multi-layered requests, a significant upgrade over rigid search algorithms. However, its success hinges on user engagement—a challenge Tubi’s discontinued experiment highlights.  \n\n#### Pros & Cons  \n<div class=\"pros-cons-container\">  \n  <div class=\"pros-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Pros</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      - **Natural language processing** improves search accuracy.  \n      - **Personalized recommendations** align with user preferences.  \n      - **Seamless integration** with Netflix’s existing UI.  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n  <div class=\"cons-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Cons</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      - **Beta limitations**: Initial rollout is iOS-only.  \n      - **Adoption risks**: Previous attempts (e.g., Tubi) failed.  \n      - **Privacy concerns**: AI processing user data.  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n</div>  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">When will the AI search tool be available globally?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Netflix plans a phased rollout, starting with iOS users in Australia and New Zealand.
