This poses significant AI code security risks, as attackers exploit these errors to launch \"package confusion\" attacks.  \n\nThe research highlights how AI tools, while efficient, may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities by generating incorrect or misleading code references. Developers are urged to scrutinize AI outputs to mitigate these emerging threats."
