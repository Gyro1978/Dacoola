    "summary": "<p>Hundreds of e-commerce sites, at least one owned by a large multinational company, were backdoored by malware that executes malicious code inside the browsers of visitors, where it can steal payment card information and other sensitive data, security researchers said Monday.</p>\n<p>The infections are the result of a supply-chain attack that compromised at least three software providers with malware that remained dormant for six years and became active only in the last few weeks. At least 500 e-commerce sites that rely on the backdoored software were infected, and it’s possible that the true number is double that, researchers from security firm Sansec <a href=\"https://sansec.io/research/license-backdoor\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>Among the compromised customers was a $40 billion multinational company, which Sansec didn’t name. In an email Monday, a Sansec representative said that “global remediation [on the infected customers] remains limited.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/hundreds-of-e-commerce-sites-hacked-in-supply-chain-attack/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/hundreds-of-e-commerce-sites-hacked-in-supply-chain-attack/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Hundreds of e-commerce sites hacked in supply-chain attack  \n\nHundreds of e-commerce sites, including one owned by a $40 billion multinational company, were infected with malware that executes malicious code in visitors' browsers, stealing payment card details and sensitive data. Security firm Sansec revealed the attack stemmed from compromised software providers, with malware lying dormant for six years before activating recently. At least 500 sites were affected, though the actual number could be double. Global remediation efforts remain limited.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis attack highlights the growing risk of supply-chain vulnerabilities in e-commerce ecosystems. By targeting software providers, hackers can infect multiple downstream businesses at once, amplifying the damage. The malware’s long dormancy suggests sophisticated planning, making detection harder. With payment data at risk, affected businesses face reputational and financial fallout, while customers may lose trust in online transactions. The incident underscores the need for stronger third-party security audits and real-time threat monitoring."
