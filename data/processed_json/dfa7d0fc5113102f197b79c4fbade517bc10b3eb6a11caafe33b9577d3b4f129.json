        "generated_article_body_md": "## OpenAI abandons plan to be controlled by for-profit board  \n\nOpenAI has scrapped its plan to transition to for-profit control after months of deliberation. The decision follows discussions with state attorneys general in Delaware and California, who could have blocked the restructuring. Instead, OpenAI’s nonprofit parent will continue overseeing its for-profit subsidiary, now structured as a public benefit corporation. CEO Sam Altman noted in an internal memo that the original governance model, which capped investor returns post-AGI, no longer fits a landscape with multiple AGI developers.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis reversal signals OpenAI’s responsiveness to regulatory and public concerns about AI governance. By retaining nonprofit oversight, the company may face stricter ethical constraints but could also avoid conflicts with policymakers and competitors like Meta. The shift to a public benefit corporation suggests a balancing act—prioritizing societal impact while operating commercially. However, the move raises questions about investor incentives and how OpenAI will navigate AGI development in a crowded field."
