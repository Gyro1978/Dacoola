The move signals a strategic push into mainstream AI adoption, potentially reshaping user expectations for AI-powered consumer experiences.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nBy prioritizing consumer use over enterprise applications, Meta is positioning itself to directly compete with popular AI-driven consumer platforms like chatbots and virtual assistants. This shift could accelerate AI integration into everyday digital interactions, influencing how people engage with social media, entertainment, and communication tools. However, the lack of a strong business focus may limit immediate adoption in professional settings, leaving room for competitors to dominate the productivity AI space."
