The move could give OpenAI visibility into how developers use rival models like Meta’s Llama variants and Anthropic’s Claude, including their specific applications.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis acquisition could provide OpenAI with valuable competitive intelligence, helping it refine its own models based on how developers leverage alternatives. However, it also raises concerns about whether Windsurf’s support for rival LLMs will continue post-acquisition. If OpenAI restricts access, developers relying on Windsurf for multi-model workflows may face disruptions, potentially reshaping the AI development ecosystem."
