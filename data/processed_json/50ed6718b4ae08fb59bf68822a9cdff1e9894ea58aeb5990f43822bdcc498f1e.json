        "generated_article_body_md": "## AWS Report: Generative AI Overtakes Security in Global Tech Budgets for 2025  \n\nA new AWS report reveals that 45% of global IT leaders now prioritize **generative AI budgets** over cybersecurity in their 2025 spending plans. Companies are aggressively hiring AI talent and implementing AI strategies, despite ongoing skills shortages in the field.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nThis shift highlights the growing dominance of generative AI as a business imperative, even surpassing traditionally critical areas like cybersecurity. The rush to adopt AI suggests organizations see immediate competitive advantages in automation, content generation, and data analysis. However, the persistent talent gap could slow implementation, creating a divide between companies that secure skilled teams early and those left scrambling. The long-term risks of deprioritizing cybersecurity also raise concerns about potential vulnerabilities in an AI-driven landscape."
