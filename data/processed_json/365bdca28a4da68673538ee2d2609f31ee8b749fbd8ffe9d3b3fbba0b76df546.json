During an interview on NBC’s *Meet the Press*, Trump reiterated his openness to extending the deadline, having already postponed the ban twice before.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThe repeated delays highlight the ongoing uncertainty surrounding TikTok’s future in the U.S. While the Trump administration has pushed for American ownership to address national security concerns, the lack of a finalized deal suggests negotiations remain complex. Another extension could buy time for stakeholders, but it also prolongs regulatory limbo for millions of TikTok users and businesses reliant on the platform."
