In coding tests like HumanEval and MultiPL-E, it matches or surpasses both Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI’s GPT-4o models.\nAccording to third-party human evaluations, it outperforms Llama 4 Maverick in 82% of coding scenarios and exceeds Command-A in nearly 70% of cases.\nThe model also performs competitively across languages and modalities.

It supports hybrid and on-premises deployment, offers custom post-training, and connects easily to business systems. According to Mistral, it’s already being used in beta by organizations in sectors such as financial services, energy, and healthcare to power domain-specific workflows and customer-facing solutions.\nMistral Medium 3 is now accessible via Mistral’s La Plateforme API and Amazon Sagemaker, with support coming soon to IBM WatsonX, NVIDIA NIM, Azure AI Foundry, and Google Cloud Vertex.\nMeanwhile, Le Chat Enterprise is available in the Google Cloud Marketplace, and will launch shortly on Azure AI and AWS Bedrock.\nFor those ready to explore the assistant experience, Le Chat is available at chat.mistral.ai, as well as in the App Store and Google Play Store, with no credit card required to get started.\nBy combining a high-efficiency model with a customizable enterprise platform, Mistral AI is making a concerted push to lower the barriers to scalable, privacy-respecting AI adoption in the enterprise world.",
