        "generated_article_body_md": "## Why Ford decided to merge its next-gen architecture with its current platform  \n\nFord hired Doug Field, former Apple and Tesla executive, in 2021 to lead its **Ford software strategy**, aiming to create smart, connected vehicles with over-the-air updates. However, amid stagnant EV sales and project delays, Field now faces the challenge of balancing Ford’s ambitious vision with current realities. The company initially sought to emulate Tesla’s seamless software experience but must now adapt its approach to integrate next-gen tech with existing platforms.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nFord’s pivot reflects broader industry struggles as legacy automakers compete with agile EV leaders like Tesla. Merging next-gen software with current systems could streamline development costs while maintaining competitiveness—but execution will be key. Field’s experience at Apple and Tesla positions him uniquely to bridge this gap, though the shift underscores the difficulty of modernizing century-old automaking processes. If successful, Ford could set a precedent for balancing innovation with practicality in the evolving auto market."
