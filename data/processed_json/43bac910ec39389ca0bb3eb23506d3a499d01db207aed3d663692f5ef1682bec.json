        "generated_article_body_md": "## NSO Group must pay more than $167 million in damages to WhatsApp for spyware campaign  \n\nA five-year legal battle between Meta-owned WhatsApp and NSO Group, one of the world’s most notorious spyware makers, has concluded with a major victory for WhatsApp. A court has ordered NSO Group to pay over $167 million in damages for its involvement in a spyware campaign targeting the messaging platform.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis ruling marks a significant legal precedent in holding spyware firms accountable for cyberattacks on digital platforms. NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware has been linked to surveillance of journalists, activists, and government critics, raising global concerns about digital privacy. The hefty damages signal that tech companies can successfully challenge spyware vendors in court, potentially deterring future unauthorized intrusions. However, enforcement remains a challenge, as NSO Group has historically operated with government backing."
