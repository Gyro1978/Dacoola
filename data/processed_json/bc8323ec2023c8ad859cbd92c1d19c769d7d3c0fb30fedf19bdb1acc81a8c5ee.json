        "generated_article_body_md": "## WhatsApp Is Walking a Tightrope Between AI Features and Privacy  \n\nWhatsApp is rolling out new AI-powered tools that rely on a system called \"Private Processing,\" designed to allow cloud-based AI functionality without compromising end-to-end encryption. The approach aims to prevent Meta—or any third party—from accessing users' private chats while still enabling AI features. However, despite these safeguards, security experts remain cautious about potential vulnerabilities in the system.  \n\nThe \"Private Processing\" framework is intended to process data locally on devices before sending anonymized inputs to the cloud for AI analysis. This method theoretically ensures that sensitive conversations stay encrypted and inaccessible to external parties. Yet, critics argue that any cloud-based interaction introduces risks, as AI models could inadvertently expose metadata or patterns that might be exploited.  \n\nWhile WhatsApp emphasizes user privacy, the challenge lies in maintaining a seamless AI experience without weakening security. The company has not disclosed full technical details, leaving some experts skeptical about whether the system can fully prevent unintended data exposure. As AI integration expands, the balance between innovation and privacy will remain a critical issue for WhatsApp and its parent company, Meta."
