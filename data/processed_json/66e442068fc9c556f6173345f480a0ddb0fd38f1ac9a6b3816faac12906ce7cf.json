Tesla is taking the hit.  \n\nElon Musk, once celebrated for transforming Tesla into an innovation leader, is now facing backlash as his political alignment with former President Trump and involvement in federal government activities create uncertainty for the company. Potential Tesla buyers are reportedly reconsidering their purchases due to Musk's polarizing political stance.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nMusk's shift into politics risks alienating Tesla's customer base, which includes environmentally conscious and progressive buyers.
