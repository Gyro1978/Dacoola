        "generated_article_body_md": "## Uber and WeRide set their robotaxi sights on 15 more cities  \n\nUber and Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide are planning a major **robotaxi expansion**, aiming to bring their commercial service to 15 additional cities over the next five years. This follows their successful launch in Abu Dhabi five months ago. The expansion will include European cities, though specific locations remain undisclosed.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis move signals growing confidence in autonomous ride-hailing as a scalable business model. By targeting Europe, Uber and WeRide are strategically expanding beyond initial test markets, potentially accelerating regulatory approvals and consumer adoption. The five-year timeline suggests a measured rollout, balancing technological readiness with market demand. If successful, this expansion could pressure competitors to accelerate their own autonomous vehicle deployments."
