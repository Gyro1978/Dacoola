    "summary": "<p>Apple’s AirPlay feature enables <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/iphone-buying-guide/\">iPhones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/which-macbook-should-you-buy/\">MacBooks</a> to seamlessly play music or show photos and videos on other Apple devices or third-party speakers and TVs that integrate the protocol. Now newly uncovered security flaws in AirPlay mean that those same wireless connections could allow hackers to move within a network just as easily, spreading malicious code from one infected device to another. Apple products are known for regularly receiving fixes, but given how rarely some smart-home devices are patched, it’s likely that these wirelessly enabled footholds for malware, across many of the hundreds of models of AirPlay-enabled devices, will persist for years to come.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, researchers from the cybersecurity firm Oligo revealed what they’re calling AirBorne, a collection of vulnerabilities affecting AirPlay, Apple’s proprietary radio-based protocol for local wireless communication. Bugs in Apple’s AirPlay software development kit (SDK) for third-party devices would allow hackers to hijack gadgets like speakers, receivers, set-top boxes, or smart TVs if they’re on the same Wi-Fi network as the hacker’s machine. Another set of AirBorne vulnerabilities would have allowed hackers to exploit AirPlay-enabled Apple devices too, Apple told Oligo, though these bugs have been patched in updates over the last several months, and Apple tells WIRED that those bugs could have only been exploited when users changed default AirPlay settings.</p>\n<p>Those Apple devices aside, Oligo’s chief technology officer and cofounder, Gal Elbaz, estimates that potentially vulnerable third-party AirPlay-enabled devices number in the tens of millions. “Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch—or they will never be patched,” Elbaz says. “And it's all because of vulnerabilities in one piece of software that affects everything.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/millions-of-apple-airplay-enabled-devices-can-be-hacked-via-wi-fi/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/millions-of-apple-airplay-enabled-devices-can-be-hacked-via-wi-fi/#comments\">Comments</a></p>",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Millions of Apple AirPlay-enabled devices can be hacked via Wi-Fi  \n\nApple’s AirPlay feature, which allows seamless streaming between iPhones, MacBooks, and third-party devices, has been found to contain critical security flaws. Dubbed \"AirBorne\" by cybersecurity firm Oligo, these **AirPlay security flaws** could let hackers infiltrate Wi-Fi networks and spread malware from one infected device to another. While Apple has patched vulnerabilities in its own devices, millions of third-party AirPlay-enabled gadgets—including speakers, smart TVs, and set-top boxes—remain at risk due to unpatched bugs in Apple’s SDK.  \n\nThe vulnerabilities stem from Apple’s AirPlay software development kit (SDK), which third-party manufacturers integrate into their devices. Hackers exploiting these flaws could hijack gadgets on the same Wi-Fi network, potentially gaining control over them. Apple has addressed some issues in its own ecosystem, but only if users altered default AirPlay settings. However, many smart home devices receive infrequent updates, leaving them exposed for years—or indefinitely.  \n\nGal Elbaz, Oligo’s CTO, estimates tens of millions of third-party devices could be affected. \"Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, many will take years to patch—or never be patched,\" Elbaz warns. The widespread adoption of AirPlay means these vulnerabilities pose a long-term threat, emphasizing the risks of relying on unpatched IoT devices."
