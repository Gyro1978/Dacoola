A recent survey found that about 1 in 6 American adults use chatbots for health advice at least monthly. However, relying too heavily on these tools poses significant **AI health advice risks**, as their outputs can be unreliable or misleading.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThe growing reliance on AI chatbots for medical guidance reflects broader challenges in healthcare accessibility, but this trend comes with serious concerns. Misdiagnoses or incorrect advice from AI could lead to delayed treatment or harmful self-medication. While chatbots may offer convenience, this study underscores the need for caution—AI should supplement, not replace, professional medical consultation. As adoption increases, regulators and developers must prioritize accuracy and transparency to mitigate risks."
