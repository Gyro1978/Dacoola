As part of the deal, Rivian will invest nearly $120 million towards the project, which is expected to directly create about 100 new jobs.

The company will invest $120 million in the project, expected to create 100 jobs and feature an underground tunnel connecting it to the main facility for seamless parts transfer. The park, already under construction and set for completion in 2026, aims to support production of Rivian’s upcoming R2 SUV and increase output of its existing R1T, R1S, and commercial vans.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis investment underscores Illinois’ commitment to strengthening its EV supply chain and attracting global manufacturing investment. By localizing suppliers, Rivian can streamline production, reduce logistics costs, and enhance scalability—critical as it prepares to launch the R2 next year. The project also signals confidence in Rivian’s growth trajectory amid broader industry challenges, positioning it to compete more effectively in the crowded EV market."
