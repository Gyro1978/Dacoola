        "generated_article_body_md": "## These Startups Are Building Advanced AI Models Without Data Centers  \n\nA new wave of startups is pioneering a decentralized approach to AI development by leveraging **crowd-trained LLMs**â€”large language models built collaboratively over the internet. Unlike traditional AI training, which relies on centralized data centers, this method taps into distributed computing power and untapped data sources. The most ambitious project in this space aims to release a 100 billion-parameter model later this year, potentially disrupting the AI industry.  \n\nThe crowd-trained approach could democratize AI development by reducing reliance on expensive infrastructure. By distributing computational workloads across contributors, these startups bypass the need for massive data centers, lowering costs and environmental impact. The upcoming 100B-parameter model, if successful, would rival proprietary models from tech giants while being developed in a more open, collaborative manner.  \n\n### Significance  \nIf this decentralized method proves viable, it could shift power dynamics in AI, enabling smaller players to compete with industry leaders. The success of crowd-trained LLMs may also accelerate innovation by leveraging diverse, globally distributed datasets that traditional models often miss."
