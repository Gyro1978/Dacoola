Developers using it can build Claude-powered apps that deliver up-to-date info, the company said in a press release published Wednesday.\nThe rollout of the API comes as AI companies look to augment their models in various ways that might attract new customers to their platforms. For its part, Anthropic last week debuted a tool to connect applications to Claude as well as an expanded “deep research” capability that lets Claude search enterprise accounts, websites, and more.\n“Developers can now augment Claude’s comprehensive knowledge with current, real-world data by enabling the web search tool when making requests to [our] API,” Anthropic wrote in its release. “With web search, developers can now build AI solutions that tap into current information without needing to manage their own web search infrastructure.”\nWhen the web search API is enabled, Claude will use “reasoning” capabilities to determine whether a given request would benefit from up-to-date information or specialized knowledge. If Claude decides to search the web, it’ll generate a search query, retrieve results, analyze them, and provide an answer with citations.\nClaude can also refine its queries and conduct multiple searches, using earlier results to inform subsequent queries. Developers can customize this behavior as well as specify domains from which Claude is allowed and not allowed to search. Devs can also allow or prohibit web search use at the organization level, Anthropic says.\nIn related news, Anthropic is bringing web search to Claude Code, its tool that allows devs to tap Claude to complete various coding tasks. With web search enabled, Claude Code can access current API documentation, technical articles, and other information on development tools and libraries.\nClaude Code remains in beta as a research preview.",

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Anthropic Launches Claude AI Web Search API for Real-Time Data Retrieval  \n\nAnthropic has unveiled a new **Claude AI web search** API, allowing developers to integrate real-time internet searches into applications powered by its Claude models. This feature enables AI solutions to fetch current information without requiring developers to manage their own search infrastructure. The API leverages Claude’s reasoning capabilities to determine when web searches are necessary, refining queries and providing answers with citations.  \n\nAdditionally, Anthropic has extended this functionality to **Claude Code**, its AI-powered coding assistant, which can now access up-to-date API documentation and technical articles. This rollout aligns with Anthropic’s broader strategy to enhance Claude’s utility for enterprise and developer use cases.  \n\n### Expanding Claude’s Capabilities with Web Search  \n\nThe new **Claude AI web search** API marks a significant step in making AI models more dynamic and responsive. Unlike static knowledge bases, this feature allows Claude to retrieve the latest information, improving accuracy for time-sensitive queries. Developers can customize search behavior, including allowed domains and organizational-level permissions, ensuring compliance with internal policies.  \n\nClaude’s ability to refine queries and conduct multiple searches in sequence enhances its research capabilities. For example, if an initial search yields incomplete results, Claude can adjust its approach, using prior findings to guide subsequent queries. This iterative process makes the AI more effective for tasks requiring deep research, such as competitive analysis or technical troubleshooting.  \n\n#### How Claude’s Web Search Works  \n\nWhen a user submits a query, Claude evaluates whether real-time data would improve the response. If so, it generates a search query, retrieves results, analyzes them, and synthesizes an answer with proper citations. This process is particularly useful for industries like finance, healthcare, and tech, where outdated information can lead to costly errors.  \n\nDevelopers can also restrict searches to trusted sources, mitigating risks associated with unreliable or biased data. This level of control ensures that AI-generated responses align with organizational standards.  \n\n#### Pros & Cons  \n\n<div class=\"pros-cons-container\">  \n  <div class=\"pros-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Pros</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      - **Real-time data access** – Ensures responses are current and relevant.  \n      - **Reduced infrastructure burden** – No need for developers to build custom search tools.  \n      - **Customizable search parameters** – Control over domains and organizational permissions.  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n  <div class=\"cons-section\">  \n    <h5 class=\"section-title\">Cons</h5>  \n    <div class=\"item-list\">  \n      - **Potential for misinformation** – Relies on external sources, which may not always be accurate.  \n      - **Beta limitations** – Claude Code’s web search is still in research preview.  \n    </div>  \n  </div>  \n</div>  \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n\n<div class=\"faq-section\">  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Can Claude AI web search be disabled for specific queries?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Yes, developers can configure the API to disable web search for certain requests or at the organization level.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n  <details class=\"faq-item\">  \n    <summary class=\"faq-question\">Does Claude AI web search support citations?</summary>  \n    <div class=\"faq-answer-content\">  \n      <p>Yes, Claude provides answers with citations, allowing users to verify sources.</p>  \n    </div>  \n  </details>  \n</div>"
