This gets fed to an AI algorithm, creating a virtual “digital twin” of the room. The model monitors patient and staff behaviour such as movement, breathing, or posture changes.

        "generated_article_body_md": "## Exclusive: Danish Supercomputer Powers AI Care ‘Companion’ for Hospitals  \n\nDanish startup Teton has leveraged Gefion, one of Europe’s most powerful supercomputers, to accelerate the development of its AI healthcare companion for hospitals. The system uses cameras and sensors to create a real-time \"digital twin\" of hospital rooms, monitoring patient and staff behavior—such as movement, breathing, and posture changes—and alerts nurses via an app if issues arise. To ensure privacy, all data processing occurs on-device, with no personal data or raw footage sent to the cloud.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \n\nThis innovation highlights how AI can enhance hospital efficiency and patient safety by providing real-time monitoring without compromising privacy. By processing data locally, Teton addresses critical concerns about patient confidentiality, setting a benchmark for ethical AI deployment in healthcare. As hospitals face increasing staffing shortages, such AI-driven solutions could become essential in maintaining high-quality care while reducing workload burdens on medical staff."
