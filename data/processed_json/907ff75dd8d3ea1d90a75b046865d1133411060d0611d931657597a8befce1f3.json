        "generated_article_body_md": "## Apple plans to split iPhone 18 launch into two phases in 2026  \nApple is reportedly planning to split the **iPhone 18 launch** into two phases in 2026, according to supply chain sources cited by *The Information*. The company will release the Pro versions in fall 2026, followed by the standard and more affordable iPhone 18 models roughly half a year later.  \n\n### Why It Matters  \nThis staggered release strategy could help Apple maximize sales momentum by targeting high-end buyers first, then capturing budget-conscious consumers later. It also reflects a growing industry trend of segmenting product launches to maintain market buzz and manage supply chain constraints. If successful, this approach may become a blueprint for future iPhone releases."
