    "summary": "<p>Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn’t always easy. That’s why we’ve created the AI Hype Index—a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-interactive diagram\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AI agents are the AI industry’s hypiest new product—intelligent assistants capable of completing tasks without human supervision. But while they can be theoretically useful—Simular AI’s S2 agent, for example, intelligently switches between models depending on what it’s been told to do—they could also be weaponized to execute cyberattacks. Elsewhere, OpenAI is reported to be throwing its hat into the social media arena, and AI models are getting more adept at making music. Oh, and if the results of the first half-marathon pitting humans against humanoid robots are anything to go by, we won’t have to worry about the robot uprising any time soon.</p>",
