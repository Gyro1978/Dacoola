                    <h2>AI Wildfire Prevention: How Startups Are Fighting Fires with Tech</h2>
<p>AI wildfire prevention is emerging as a critical tool in combating increasingly destructive fires. Startups like Pano AI and Green Grid are deploying AI-driven cameras and sensors to detect fires early, monitor controlled burns, and help first responders act faster. With wildfires in the Los Angeles area causing over $164 billion in damages this year alone, these technologies could reshape firefighting strategies.  </p>
<h3>Key Innovations in AI Wildfire Prevention</h3>
<p>Pano AI’s Pano Station uses ultra-high-definition cameras mounted on mountain peaks to scan for smoke up to 10 miles away. The system sends images to cloud-based AI models running on NVIDIA GPUs, which analyze them for signs of fire. Human operators verify detections before alerts are sent to fire departments, reducing response times compared to traditional 911 calls.  </p>
<p>Green Grid, another AI wildfire prevention leader, provides utility companies with real-time alerts. In one case, it warned a Big Bear resort of an approaching fire, allowing early suppression efforts. CEO Chinmoy Saha emphasized that early detection is crucial to preventing small fires from becoming catastrophic.  </p>
<h3>Controlled Burns and AI Monitoring</h3>
<p>California’s fire agencies are increasingly relying on prescribed burns to reduce wildfire risks. AI helps monitor these controlled fires, ensuring they stay within designated zones. Pano AI’s cameras track smoke plumes, while Green Grid’s trailer-mounted sensors provide additional oversight.  </p>
<p>CAL FIRE, in partnership with Alert California and UC San Diego, uses an AI-powered camera network to detect new fire starts. The system updates every two minutes and flags potential fires for human verification. Battalion Chief David Acuna noted that catching fires early-before they exceed a few acres-dramatically improves containment success.  </p>
