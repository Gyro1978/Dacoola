                    <h2>Google Privacy Settlement: Texas Secures $1.375 Billion Over Unauthorized Tracking</h2>
<p>Google has agreed to pay Texas $1.375 billion to settle two lawsuits alleging the company unlawfully tracked users' personal data, including location, incognito searches, voiceprints, and facial geometry without consent. The settlement, announced by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, marks the largest recovery against Google under state privacy laws.  </p>
<p>While Google denies wrongdoing, the resolution closes cases accusing the tech giant of deceptive practices. "In Texas, Big Tech is not above the law," Paxton stated, emphasizing the state's aggressive stance on privacy enforcement.  </p>
<h3>Legal and Regulatory Fallout</h3>
<p>The lawsuits, filed in 2022, accused Google of exploiting user data across multiple services. Paxton's office highlighted that the company continued tracking even when users believed their activities were private, such as in incognito mode. Google defended its practices, stating features like facial recognition in Google Photos were designed for organizational purposes, not advertising.  </p>
<p>This settlement follows Meta's similar $1 billion payout last year over facial recognition violations, signaling heightened scrutiny of Big Tech's data practices. Google's legal challenges persist, including antitrust rulings that may force structural changes like divesting Chrome.  </p>
<h4>Broader Implications for Tech Accountability</h4>
<p>The Texas settlement underscores growing state-led efforts to regulate tech giants amid stalled federal privacy legislation. "This victory sets a precedent for holding corporations accountable," Paxton noted, linking the outcome to his broader political campaign against incumbent Senator John Cornyn.  </p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, maintains its commitment to updated privacy controls. Spokesperson José Castañeda called the settlement a chance to move past "old claims," though critics argue the payout reflects systemic issues in data transparency.</p>
