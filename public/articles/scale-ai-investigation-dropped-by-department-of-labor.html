                    <h2>Scale AI Investigation Dropped by Department of Labor</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has closed its investigation into Scale AI’s compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), according to a source familiar with the matter. The FLSA governs worker classification and wage disputes, and Scale AI, valued at $13.8 billion, relies heavily on contractors for tasks like data labeling. The DOL also ended probes into HR partners Upwork and HireArt.  </p>
<h3>Background and Implications</h3>
<p>Scale AI has faced lawsuits from former workers alleging misclassification as independent contractors, which denied them benefits like sick leave. The company’s reliance on contract labor is common in AI development, where large-scale data labeling is often outsourced. The DOL’s decision to drop the investigation comes amid a broader shift in labor policy.  </p>
<p>On May 1, the agency announced it would no longer enforce a Biden-era rule that made classifying workers as contractors more difficult. This change suggests a more lenient stance toward gig economy models. Scale AI’s spokesperson, Joe Osborne, stated the company is “pleased with this update,” emphasizing the importance of flexible work opportunities in AI.  </p>
<h4>Political and Industry Context</h4>
<p>Scale AI has sought alignment with the Trump administration. CEO Alexandr Wang attended Trump’s inauguration and publicly urged the administration to prioritize AI competitiveness. Additionally, former Scale AI managing director Michael Kratsios now leads the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, though this role does not oversee the DOL.  </p>
<p>The reasons behind the DOL’s decision remain unclear. Possible factors include policy shifts, insufficient evidence, or political considerations. The agency did not respond to requests for comment.  </p>
