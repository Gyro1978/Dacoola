                        <h2>Apple Seeks Delay on Court Ruling Barring App Payment Commissions</h2>
<p>Apple has filed an emergency motion to delay a court ruling that would prevent the company from collecting commissions on payments made outside its App Store ecosystem. The ruling, issued last week in favor of Epic Games, requires Apple to allow U.S. developers to redirect users to external payment systems without charging fees or displaying warnings.  </p>
<p>The iPhone maker argues that the decision expands the scope of a 2021 injunction and could cause "grave irreparable harm" to its business. Apple has already complied with part of the order by permitting external payment links but continues to impose a 27% fee on such transactions.  </p>
<h3>Legal Battle and Financial Stakes</h3>
<p>The latest ruling stems from a long-running antitrust case brought by Epic Games, which challenged Apple's control over in-app payments. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple failed to fully comply with the 2021 injunction, leading to stricter enforcement. The new order prohibits Apple from collecting commissions on external transactions and restricts its ability to influence how developers present alternative payment options.  </p>
<p>Apple contends that the court overstepped by penalizing the company for conduct not previously deemed unlawful. In its filing, Apple warned of "substantial sums annually" in lost revenue if the ruling takes effect. The company has already appealed the decision, signaling a prolonged legal battle ahead.  </p>
<h4>Developer Reactions and Market Impact</h4>
<p>Major app developers like Spotify and Amazon have already updated their apps to bypass Apple's payment system, taking advantage of the 2021 injunction. The new ruling could accelerate this trend, further eroding Apple's lucrative App Store fees, which contribute significantly to its services revenue.  </p>
<p>However, smaller developers may hesitate to adopt external payment systems due to Apple's continued enforcement of its 27% commission. The court's decision to block "scare screens" could level the playing field, but Apple's latest legal maneuver suggests the fight is far from over.  </p>
