                    <h2>AI Use Negatively Impacts Professional Reputation, Study Shows</h2>
<p>Employees who rely on AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini at work may face unintended consequences, according to research from Duke University. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that workers using AI assistance are often perceived as less competent, lazier, and more replaceable by colleagues and managers.  </p>
<h3>The Hidden Social Cost of AI Adoption</h3>
<p>The Duke research team conducted four experiments involving over 4,400 participants to examine how AI use affects professional reputation. Their findings, detailed in the paper "Evidence of a social evaluation penalty for using AI," show consistent negative judgments across demographics. Employees who disclosed AI assistance were rated as less diligent, independent, and self-assured compared to those who used traditional tools or received no help.  </p>
<p>What surprised researchers was the universal nature of this bias. "The social stigmatization of AI use is not limited to particular demographic groups," the authors noted. Whether considering age, gender, or occupation, the pattern held: AI-assisted work triggered skepticism about a professional's capabilities.  </p>
<h4>Workplace Perceptions and AI Disclosure</h4>
<p>In one experiment, participants imagined using either AI or conventional tools at work. Those in the AI group anticipated harsher judgments and reported being less willing to admit their AI use. A follow-up study confirmed these fears-when evaluating worker profiles, participants consistently downgraded those who received AI help, regardless of the quality of their output.  </p>
<p>This research highlights a growing tension in modern workplaces. While AI can improve efficiency, its use may come with professional reputation risks that could affect career advancement and workplace relationships.  </p>
