                    <h2>Apple App Store Revenue Surpasses $10 Billion in US for 2024</h2>
<p>Apple’s U.S. App Store generated more than $10.1 billion in commissions last year, according to a new analysis by app intelligence firm Appfigures. This marks a significant increase from 2020, when Apple’s share of App Store revenue was approximately $4.76 billion. The growth highlights the platform’s financial dominance despite recent legal challenges.  </p>
<p>Developers in the U.S. earned $33.68 billion in gross revenue from apps and games using Apple’s payment system in 2024, retaining $23.57 billion after Apple’s 30% commission. Globally, Appfigures estimates the App Store made $91.3 billion in 2024, with Apple collecting $27.39 billion in fees.  </p>
<h3>Key Trends and Legal Implications</h3>
<p>The report reveals a discrepancy between Apple’s and Appfigures’ revenue calculations. Apple previously claimed $104 billion in global billings for 2022, but Appfigures’ data shows $61.5 billion for the same period. The difference stems from Apple’s broader definition of "billings and sales," which includes revenue facilitated by Apple devices even if purchases occurred outside the App Store.  </p>
<p>Recent court rulings have forced Apple to adjust its policies. A judge found the company in "willful violation" of a 2021 injunction by charging a 27% fee on external transactions. Now, developers can link to alternative payment methods without penalties. Apps like Spotify and Amazon Kindle have already adopted this change.  </p>
<p>Apple is appealing the decision, arguing it causes "grave irreparable harm." The company maintains that the ruling unfairly penalizes its business model.  </p>
<h4>Revenue Breakdown and Market Impact</h4>
<p>Games contributed $3.83 billion to Apple’s U.S. App Store revenue in 2024, while other apps accounted for $6.28 billion. The figures underscore the platform’s importance to Apple’s financial strategy.  </p>
<p>As legal battles continue, the future of Apple App Store revenue remains uncertain. Developers and regulators are pushing for lower commissions, while Apple defends its current structure.</p>
