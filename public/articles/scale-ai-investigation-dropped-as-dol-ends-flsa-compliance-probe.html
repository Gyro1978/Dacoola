                    <h2>Scale AI Investigation Dropped as DOL Ends FLSA Compliance Probe</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has terminated its investigation into Scale AI’s compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), according to a source familiar with the matter. The probe, first reported by TechCrunch in March, examined allegations of worker misclassification and unpaid wages. Scale AI, valued at $13.8 billion, relies on contractors for critical AI labeling tasks, but former workers have sued, claiming they were denied employee benefits.  </p>
<h3>Key Developments in the Scale AI Probe</h3>
<p>The DOL’s decision to drop the investigation comes amid shifting federal labor policies. On May 1, the agency announced it would no longer enforce a Biden-era rule that made classifying workers as independent contractors more difficult. This policy shift may have influenced the DOL’s approach to Scale AI’s case.  </p>
<p>Scale AI’s spokesperson, Joe Osborne, confirmed the news, stating, <em>“We’re pleased with this update. Creating new forms of work in AI is vital to America’s economic growth.”</em> The company has faced lawsuits from former workers alleging underpayment and misclassification, but the DOL has not disclosed specific reasons for ending the probe.  </p>
<h3>Political and Regulatory Context</h3>
<p>Scale AI has sought alignment with the Trump administration, with CEO Alexandr Wang attending Trump’s inauguration and advocating for AI dominance. Additionally, former Scale AI managing director Michael Kratsios now leads the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, though this role does not oversee the DOL.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Upwork and HireArt-Scale AI’s HR partners-also confirmed their investigations were closed. The broader implications for gig economy labor standards remain uncertain as regulatory priorities shift.  </p>
