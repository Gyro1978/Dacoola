                    <h2>AI in Healthcare: Ottawa Hospital Reduces Burnout by 70% with Voice Capture</h2>
<p>The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) has significantly improved clinician efficiency and patient satisfaction by integrating Microsoft’s DAX Copilot, an AI-powered ambient voice capture tool. Early results show a 70% reduction in physician burnout, seven minutes saved per patient encounter, and 97% of patients reporting a better or equivalent care experience.  </p>
<h3>Key Innovations &amp; Clinical Impact</h3>
<p>TOH became the first Canadian hospital to pilot Microsoft’s DAX Copilot, which works alongside Epic’s electronic health record (EHR) system. The AI tool records physician-patient conversations via a mobile app and generates real-time clinical notes, eliminating manual documentation. "Instead of typing or remembering details, physicians get an accurate draft immediately after the visit," explained Kenn Harper, Microsoft’s head of project for Dragon.  </p>
<p>The system continuously improves through feedback loops, analyzing clinician edits to refine its summaries. Specialized models for different medical fields further enhance accuracy. Glen Kearns, TOH’s CIO, noted that reducing after-hours charting has been transformative: "Physicians engage more intentionally with patients, increasing throughput per shift."  </p>

    <div class="item-list">  
      <ul>  
        <li>Saves seven minutes per patient encounter, improving workflow efficiency.</li>  
        <li>Reduces cognitive load, allowing physicians to focus on patient care.</li>  
        <li>97% patient satisfaction due to more meaningful interactions.</li>

  <div class="cons-section">  
    <h5 class="section-title">Cons</h5>  
    <div class="item-list">  
      <ul>  
        <li>Requires patient consent for recording, which may raise privacy concerns for some.</li>  
        <li>Early-stage adoption means further refinements are needed for broader use.</li>  
      </ul>  
    </div>  
  </div>  
</div>

<h4>Future Applications in AI in Healthcare</h4>
<p>TOH is also testing "digital teammates" like Sophie, an AI avatar that interprets patient sentiment and assists with follow-ups. Kearns envisions AI handling biomarker detection and social determinants of health, such as identifying unmet needs like transportation barriers. "We’re shifting from reactive to proactive care," he said.  </p>
