                    <h2>Google to pay Texas $1.4 billion in privacy settlement</h2>
<p>Google has agreed to pay Texas $1.375 billion to resolve two lawsuits accusing the company of tracking users' location, incognito searches, voice, and facial data without consent. The settlement marks one of the largest privacy-related payouts by the tech giant.  </p>
<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who filed the lawsuits in 2022, stated the agreement reinforces that "Big Tech is not above the law." Google maintains it settled without admitting wrongdoing and says it has already updated the policies in question.  </p>
<h3>Legal and financial implications</h3>
<p>The settlement follows similar actions against Meta last year, where the company paid a comparable amount over facial recognition concerns. Paxton's office claims this is the largest recovery against Google under state privacy laws.  </p>
<p>Google spokesperson José Castañeda emphasized that the lawsuits addressed outdated policies, adding that the company has since implemented stronger privacy controls. The tech giant also secured partial legal victories earlier, including an appeals court ruling questioning Texas' jurisdiction over the case.  </p>
<h3>Broader regulatory context</h3>
<p>This agreement arrives amid heightened scrutiny of Google's business practices. Recent antitrust rulings found the company unlawfully maintained monopolies in search and advertising, with potential remedies including divesting its Chrome browser. Google plans to appeal those decisions.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Paxton, a prominent critic of major tech firms, has announced a bid for the U.S. Senate in next year's midterm elections.  </p>
