                    <h2>Bill Gates Directs Gates Foundation to Spend Entire $200 Billion by 2045</h2>
<p>Bill Gates has announced that his foundation must exhaust its $200 billion endowment by 2045, accelerating its philanthropic mission. The Microsoft co-founder, who plans to donate 99% of his $107 billion fortune, revised the foundation’s original timeline, which was tied to his death. The Gates Foundation, now 25 years old, has already spent over $100 billion on global health, education, and development.  </p>
<h3>A Strategic Shift in Philanthropy</h3>
<p>Gates described the decision as part of a personal reflection, coinciding with milestones including his 70th birthday and Microsoft’s 50th anniversary. The revised deadline ensures the foundation will operate for just 20 more years, a significant departure from its previous indefinite lifespan. With an expected annual expenditure of $9 billion, the foundation’s accelerated spending could amplify its impact on global health crises like malaria and gender inequality.  </p>
<p>Warren Buffett’s contributions may still surpass Gates’s as the largest philanthropic gift in U.S. history. However, the Gates Foundation’s revised timeline underscores a growing trend among billionaires to allocate wealth more aggressively during their lifetimes.  </p>
<h4>Impact on Global Aid</h4>
<p>The announcement comes amid U.S. foreign aid cuts, with agencies like USAID facing reduced funding. The Gates Foundation’s sustained $9 billion yearly spending could help fill gaps in low-income countries, particularly in healthcare and education.  </p>
